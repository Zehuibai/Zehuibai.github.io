# Histogram

In data analysis, especially when dealing with questionnaire data, `geom_histogram()` in `ggplot2` can be an essential tool for visualizing the distribution of responses. Histograms are particularly effective for showing the frequency of score occurrences across a range of values, making them ideal for summarizing the results from questionnaires where responses are often scaled (e.g., Likert scales from 1 to 5).
 

1. **Data Structure Preparation**: Your dataset should contain numeric or ordinal scale responses to questionnaire items. Each response is treated as an individual data point.

2. **Plotting with `geom_histogram()`**:
   - **Bin Settings**: By default, `geom_histogram()` will attempt to create 30 bins of equal width, but for questionnaire data, you might set the `binwidth` to 1 if your data are integers representing something like a Likert scale. This will create a bin for each possible score, aligning perfectly with the questionnaire's scoring system.
   - **Aesthetic Mapping**: Map the x-axis to your questionnaire score variable. Optionally, you can fill the bars based on another variable, such as different groups or demographics within your survey population, to compare distributions across categories.
   - **Position Adjustment**: If you are filling based on a factor (like age group or gender), using `position = "dodge"` will place the groups side by side for easier comparison, rather than the default stacking.

3. **Customizations and Improvements**:
   - **Labels and Titles**: Adding clear labels for the x-axis and y-axis, as well as a descriptive title, can help in immediately understanding the plot’s purpose. For instance, x could be "Questionnaire Score" and y "Frequency of Responses".
   - **Theme Adjustments**: Customize the plot appearance using `theme()` to improve readability and presentation quality. For example, adjusting text size, changing the legend position, or modifying background colors.

4. **Statistical Overlays**:
   - **Adding Mean/Mode Lines**: You can overlay additional information such as a vertical line showing the mean or mode of the distribution using `geom_vline()`, which can provide insights into the central tendency of the responses.
   - **Annotations**: Annotate specific features of the histogram, like notable peaks or unusual gaps, to draw attention to important aspects of the data.

5. **Analysis Interpretation**:
   - Histograms allow you to quickly grasp the distribution of responses, identify common and outlier responses, and assess the skewness or symmetry of the data.
   - By comparing histograms from different demographic groups, you can explore how opinions or behaviors differ across these groups, potentially guiding more detailed statistical tests or reporting insights.

#  CGI-S

## Barplot for

The clinical global impression – severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The challenge was to provide data visualisations to show this data and also to provide comparisons between the different groups (e.g. based on response differences or odds ratios for the different response categories) using Clinical Global Impression Data.

# CGI-I

The **Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)** scale is a widely used tool in clinical trials and practice to evaluate the overall change in a patient's clinical condition over time, as perceived by the clinician. It is often used in conjunction with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the relevance and clinical significance of observed changes.
 

1. **Purpose**:
   - The CGI-I measures the degree of improvement (or worsening) in a patient's condition compared to baseline, from the clinician's perspective.
   - It provides an overall, global impression, considering all available information, including clinical observations and patient-reported experiences.

2. **Scale**:
   - CGI-I is typically a 7-point scale, where:
     - 1 = Very much improved
     - 2 = Much improved
     - 3 = Minimally improved
     - 4 = No change
     - 5 = Minimally worse
     - 6 = Much worse
     - 7 = Very much worse

3. **Relation to Clinically Meaningful Differences**:
   - **Clinically meaningful differences** help define thresholds where changes in outcomes are considered significant or relevant to patients and clinicians.
   - By comparing changes in PROs (like pain scores or quality of life measures) to the CGI-I ratings, researchers can determine what magnitude of change on the PRO corresponds to meaningful improvement in the clinician's eyes.
   - For instance, if a 4-point decrease in a symptom severity score consistently aligns with a "Much improved" (rating of 2) on the CGI-I, this threshold can guide interpretation of treatment effects.

4. **Utility in Research**:
   - **Anchor-Based Methodology**: CGI-I often serves as an anchor in defining clinically meaningful changes in PROs because it reflects a holistic and intuitive judgment from the clinician.
   - **Validation**: PRO instruments may be validated by examining how well their scores correlate with CGI-I ratings.

## Stacked Bar Chart

*Annotation (circling Site 4 in red) and sorting (Site 4 in the upper left hand corner) to make clear that Site 4 is a visual outlier. The visual idiom is a stacked bar chart, one color for each questionnaire. Stacked barcharts are limited when comparing any of the components except the one on the bottom. For the purpose of this data viz challenge, it was only necessary to compare the totals, ie the heights of the stacked bars. This is easy to do for the stacked bars from a visual perception point of view. But the colors for the different components (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) can be distracting.*

```{r,echo = T,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("./01_Datasets/PROdata.csv")

# Convert data to long format for easier plotting with ggplot2
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Q"), names_to = "Question", values_to = "Score")

# Calculate average scores by SITE, TRT, and Question
avg_scores <- data_long %>%
  group_by(SITE, TRT, Question) %>%
  summarise(Average_Score = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot
ggplot(avg_scores, aes(x = TRT, y = Average_Score, fill = Question)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  facet_wrap(~ SITE, ncol = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Scores by Site and Treatment Group",
    subtitle = "Site 04 is the only site with lower average scores for active and higher for control across all PROs",
    x = "Treatment Group",
    y = "Average Score",
    fill = "PRO"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

```


## Slope Plots

Leverage visual analytics to identify data issues. Consider 4 questions on a Likert scale. 5 rating levels (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree) coded as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The higher the number the better. 400 Subjects (200 active, 200 control).

*We can clearly see that Site 4 is a visual outlier. The Active data for Site 4 looks like it belongs with the Control data from the other sites and likewise the Contorl data for Site 4 looks like it belo9ngs with the Active data from the other sites. Color and a useful title are used to highlight the difference.*

## Cumulative distribution plot

## Exploring Uncertainty

This graph is formed in two panels, with the left panel showing the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots of percentage change from baseline in score, grouped by the anchor measure. A measure of variability has been added to the plot, derived using bootstrapping methods. The right panel is showing 95% CIs and 95% Prediction Intervals of scores for each category.

CDF plots used for comparing distributions are sometimes superimposed, so this approach may have been useful. However the confidence envelopes couldn’t then be shown simultaneously, so there’d need to be a way of interactively selecting one category at a time. Use of percentage change was discussed – absolute changes are often preferable in a scenario where clinical meaningful changes are being assessed.

## Spaghetti and Distribution Plot

The upper part of the graph is showing the distribution of the score values within each CGI-I category, using density plots of scores on an absolute scale. Distributions are shown separately for baseline and follow-up visits within each category, rather than change from baseline. Individual patient and mean changes are shown using slope plots.

The lower part of the graph shows the distribution of change from baseline values, with a measure of variability being derived using bootstrapping methods. Colour has been used to show paired mean differences outside a +/- 10 unit range.

In general, the graph contains a lot of information and takes some time to understand. However the graph tells a clear story in terms of the distribution of score across different categories, and shows clearly that the Minimally Improved category does not seem to be well differentiated from No Change category.

## Distribution Plot by Category I

This graph includes stacked density plots, sometimes known as a ridgeline plot. This graph type is useful where there are approximately 4-8 categories with a natural ordering, which is the case in this example. The graph is also showing patient level data as transparent dots on the X axis, and reference lines have been added. There is a lot of overplotting of the dots, so the opacity of dots is representing the data density at each value on the X-axis.

## Dot plot

This graph used a different approach, showing only the patient-level data within each category as a scatter plot, with added jittering. The trend between categories is clear, and the number of patients can be compared between groups visually. It was noted that some people find it hard to compare distributions from scatter plots, so a hybrid of scatter plot and a elements showing the distribution, e.g. boxplot or density plot, may have been useful. However the author of the graph mentioned that this graph was intended to be used at the first step of an assessment, to answer the question “is CGI a good enough measure to investigate the meaningful change threshold”

# EORTC QLQ-C30

The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that has been designed for use in a wide range of cancer patient populations and is a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life in cancer patients. It includes a number of different scales, but this challenge is focussed on the global health and quality of life scale (QL).

## Individual Patient Trajectories

EORTC QLQ-C30 is quality of life (QoL) questionnaire designed for use in cancer patients Each item is rated on a 4-point response scale ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very much”) or a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (“Very poor”) to 7 (“Excellent”).

Higher scores represent better outcomes for the global health scale (QL) and the functional scales (PF, RF, EF, CF, SF), whereas higher scores represent higher severe symptoms for the symptom scales/items (FA, NV, PA, DY, SL, AP, CO, DI, FI). The overall QLQ-C30 score is calculated using scoring rules to a range of 0-100.

This figure of change from baseline in QLQ-C30 over time is showing patient-level data as individual lines. Although this is technically a spaghetti plot, a lot of over-plotting occurs due to the discrete nature of the score values. Where this occurs, the opacity of the lines depends on the number of lines that are superimposed, so the figure gives an good general impression of the overall trend. In the left panel (control group), there seem to be more darker lines in the lower half of the plot, showing a worsening of QoL, while the opposite is true in the right panel (experimental group). The figure also includes a superimposed line plot of mean over time (+/- standard error), which shows a similar trend of improvement in global health status in the experimental group and a worsening in the control group.

The use of faint grey gridlines is quite effective. The possibility of using a greyscale for the patient-level data was discussed, because the colour isn’t coding any information and this would make the line plot of mean over time stand out, but it was agreed this would make the patient-level data difficult to distinguish against the gridlines. Some design improvements were suggested, making some of the labels a little larger, and there is also some scope for decluttering the graph, e.g. removing the Y-axis label from the right panel.

## Top four domains Trajectories Dashboard

[App](https://agstn.github.io/qlq-c30/qlq-c30_flexdashboard.html)

First tab: This tab focuses on only the top four domains, in terms of treatment effect. The left panel is showing patient-level data, similarly to the first entry, although data have been jittered to avoid over-plotting. The middle panel shows point estimates, credible intervals and posterior distributions for each treatment and timepoint from from a Bayesian MMRM model. Posterior distributions for the treatment differences are shown in the right panel, with cutpoints added to the density plots to indicate clinically-meaningful threshold values.The graph includes a lot of information but is highly effective in showing trends in the data.

Second tab: this shows the treatment differences for all domains, including point estimates, credible intervals and Bayesian posterior distributions. The domains are sorted in terms of treatment effect, so it is very clear which domains are driving the overall treatment effect. Shading has been used to represent different parts of the posterior distribution curve with respect to the threshold values.

Further tabs give the user a more focused view of what we saw in the first tab, i.e. patient-level data, results of the MMRM and treatment differences, for a single domain, e.g. quality of life, functional scales, symptoms and financial difficulties.

The consistent colour-coding across all panels is helpful, and the colours are similar with respect to their intensity. For the second tab, representing time on the vertical axis is unsual and possibly counter intuitive, but an alternative design may have difficult to implement. Also in the second tab, annotations hadn’t been added to show which direction represents a benefit for each of the scales (which was present on the first tab and was very helpful). But overall this package of graphs provides a rich source of information and clearly shows the important features of the data.

# Responder Rate

In a Phase III study involving patients suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa, an active drug was compared to a placebo. Each group consisted of 200 subjects, and the primary endpoint was the HiSCR, which is a binary endpoint. This endpoint is based on three continuous components:

1. Number of abscesses
2. Number of draining fistulae
3. Number of inflammatory nodules

A patient achieves a HiSCR response if all of the following three conditions are met when comparing baseline data to follow-up data (at week 16):

1. At least a 50% decrease in the AN count; AN count is defined as the sum of the number of abscesses and the number of inflammatory nodules.
2. No increase in the number of abscesses.
3. No increase in the number of draining fistulae.

The aim of the study was to compare the two treatment arms in regard to the HiSCR response.

The challenge lies in visualizing the impact of changing the definition of the HiSCR response on the results. For example, altering the first condition to assume that a decrease of 25% or 75% is needed to achieve a HiSCR response could be considered. The second and third conditions could be changed separately, or a mix of changes to two or all conditions can be applied. How does this impact the results?

## Line plots based on reduction in AN count

This visualization shows nicely that the difference between the groups is rather small, if the percentage change to be reached is large (focusing on the first part of the HiSCR responder definition). This is done by presenting a line plot for both groups using two different colors. There are three graphs. Each one of them keeps the second and/or the third part of the definition of a HiSCR responder fixed. Overall, it is a very clean visualization which very nicely tackles the challenge of showing the impact of chaning the definition of HiSCR response.

## Shiny Apps

The app can be found [here](https://bonorico.shinyapps.io/HiSCR/?_ga=2.91645274.1120831357.1651571388-1024467400.1644592220).

This visualization shows on the y-axis the inverse of the risk ratio and on the x-axis the threshold for the percentage decrease in AN count. It is actually an animation showing the impact of changing the threshold for the change of abscesses from baseline. This is a very useful graph to visualize what happens if you change different aspects of the definition. 


![](./02_Plots/Visualization/PRO/Responder_Shiny_a.png)

This is a very simple app which allows you to change the definition of the HiSCR definition (on the left-hand side) to see what happens in the results (on the right-hand side). See [*Shiny\Data Visualization\Responder Bar*]

![](./02_Plots/Visualization/PRO/Responder_Shiny_b.png)

This is a very advanced app which shows a volcano plot in the main panel and it shows what happends in the results when you change the definition on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, you see a table with additional results based on different HiSCR definitions. The panel thinks that it is a not necessarily straightforward to see what is being shown here. However, it is still a very insightful and useful app to understand the impact of changing the definition of HiSCR.

The app can be found [here](https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-06-wonderful-wednesdays-may-2022/images/HiSCR_fig%20-%20Agustin%20Calatroni.html).

# Clinical Improvement 

The data reflects a phase III study - active vs placebo and the endpoint was Ordinal Scale for Improvement (OSCI). All patients started at OSCI=4 and daily measures over 35 days were performed. The challenge was to describe the treatment effect specifically taking into account the number and timing of patients who died, left the hospital or fully recovered.

# Regression model-Prediction of health status (EQ-5D)

The data is based on a study to assess the health status in patients with coronary heart diseases (see Ose et al., 2012). The research question was: what factors are associated with health status in usual primary care?

The original data included 2,656 patients with 14 (patient and practice) characteristics (with clustered data structure). The outcome was EQ-5D VAS scale (Health related quality of life; range: [0; 1]). The data set for this challenge is a sub-sample of patients and variables and it is simulated data.
