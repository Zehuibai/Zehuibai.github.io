# DLQI

In this month’s dataset, DLQI has been administered in a phase 3 clinical trial to patients with psoriasis. There are two imbalanced treatment groups, with 150 patients randomised to Placebo (Treatment A) and 450 to the active treatment (Treatment B). DLQI responses are recorded at Baseline and Week 16 (although some DLQI assessment is missing at Week 16), allowing the treatment effect in terms of Quality of Life to be assessed. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is also recorded at baseline.

## Change in mean scores

The dot plot displayed here is a great way to quickly see the effect of treatment on the different DLQI items. For each item and each group, we see mean scores for both Baseline and Week 16, which are coloured differently and consistently to allow patterns to be quickly and easily identified. Whilst it is not something commonly seen, the position of the legend in the middle of the page works really nicely and can be quickly referenced for each plot.

Overall, this is a very clean design and provides a clear message. However, there were some ways in which the panel felt that the layout of this example could be improved. Whilst it is easy to compare within treatment groups, it is not so easy to make comparisons between treatment groups here. The group proposed combining the two treatment groups in a vertical layout, possibly using different colours to differentiate between treatment groups and arrows to indicate the direction of the effect. This would also mean that labels of the different items would not need to be repeated as they currently are. This vertical structure could be accommodated by using less space for the first figure showing effect sizes on overall means. Having this so large is not necessarily a bad thing if it shows key information which needs to be emphasised, but we should be intentional about it when doing things such as this.

Unlike in the previous example, here the items are sorted in the order they appear on the questionnaire. Alternative ways to sort the items could be considered to highlight those which are most interesting, such as sorting by baseline means or by effect size. There are also a few tweaks to the horizontal axes which the group felt should be made. Firstly, it would be better to start from zero on the first dot plot, otherwise the effect size appears to be exaggerated. Further, the horizontal axes and spacing between labels should be made consistent for the two treatment groups, allowing for direct comparison between the two figures.

## Lineplots

These slope graphs provide a clear and meaningful picture of patient level changes in DLQI scores for the different items and treatment groups. Here, the circles are proportional to the percentage of patients with a given response to that item at that visit, and the strips represents the ‘flow’ of patients across response levels between the visits. The decision to make the circles proportional to percentages rather than counts is the correct one here and allows for meaningful comparison between the imbalanced treatment groups.

This is a really nice example of a plot type which we don’t often see and tells a good story. The consistent improvement for the active treatment is clear to see and we see that there is not too much happening in terms of a response for placebo. Whilst we do not get the same level of understanding of marginal distributions that we might with a histrogram, we do still get some notion and this is balanced by the additional level of patient understanding which we have.

The group liked how the flow of patients could easily be seen by the intensity of lines, but felt that either a greater level of ‘minimum’ intensity or a different colour to blue could be used to still allow even a single patient’s movement to be seen, which is currently slightly difficult. However, it was acknowledged that not being able to see a lot within certain items for placebo is in itself meaningful.

The consistent use of colour between plots and titles allows us to easily distinguish between treatment groups, although it was felt that a more telling title may have been used. It is great that item descriptions rather than just numbers are provided, and the panel really liked that we see the effects when certain items are combined together into different domains. Grouping of the ten DLQI items into these six domains is something which is commonly done in clinical practice but is not something which was considered by many of the other examples. It was acknowledged that the inclusion of these additional plots for the six domains justifies keeping the items ordered as they appear on the questionnaire, so we can clearly see which items correspond to which domains. However, there was still some discussion as to whether an alternative ordering of both individual items and domains could be considered.

This example has a long, vertical layout. This would be great for something like a poster, but is maybe less convenient for viewing on screen. There was a feeling that when being presented as a poster, a lighter background may be more suitable.

## Mixed models

we have the results of mixed models visualised in an interactive html document. The figure is split into three columns, allowing us to see all of the effects we may be interested in: treatment by visit; within treatment, between visit differences; between treatment, between treatment differences.

One of the features that is really nice about this example is that, unlike many other examples, it considers an alternative way to sort the different items using a dendrogram. This allows us to quickly see two clear clusters in the items, although it was felt that total score should not have been included in this clustering. It is also great that the distributions are shown around the estimated effects, allowing us to quickly see the uncertainty in these estimates.

There were mixed feelings around the large amount of white space included in some of the columns. In some ways, this could be seen as unnecessary, but it was pointed out that the white space provides a nice level of consistency, allowing us to get an immediate impression of effect sizes on the upper plots which are quite a way from the labels on the horizontal axis. The vertical reference lines included are also really nice for getting a quick impression of effect sizes and how meaningful these are.

Similarly, there were mixed feelings around the level of complexity of this example, with the conclusion being that its appropriateness would largely depend on how technical the audience was. Whilst it may be slightly difficult for a non-technical audience to understand, it was felt that this example would be great for providing a large amount of information to technical audiences, particularly given that tables of values were provided in additional tabs alongside the figure. The group envisaged many applications where similar figures would be great to have, such as meta-analyses and subgroup analyses.

The final thing discussed at length for this example was the representation of the effect sizes. The group really liked that the colours used correspond to those provided in the above text, allowing us to determine treatment groups without the need for a legend. Similarly, it was great to see the different effect sizes consistently pointing either upwards or downwards for the different treatment groups, although it would be beneficial to have this also described in the text. This would allow the figure to be interpreted without having to be able to distinguish between the colours.

The panel highlighted a really nice tool which allows us to see how easily certain colours are distinguished by individuals with different kinds of colour-blindness. Whilst it was shown that the blue and green used here are not too difficult to distinguish for most individuals, the tool was used to identify colours which could be even easier to differentiate between.

## Barplot to show the reduction in treatment effect on DLQI

This graphic is similar to the first one except it uses a barchart instead of a lollipop chart and it includes a completers analysis. The title explains the results and the reference line for the marginal treatment effect provides a good reference for the reader.

## Histogram


In data analysis, especially when dealing with questionnaire data, `geom_histogram()` in `ggplot2` can be an essential tool for visualizing the distribution of responses. Histograms are particularly effective for showing the frequency of score occurrences across a range of values, making them ideal for summarizing the results from questionnaires where responses are often scaled (e.g., Likert scales from 1 to 5).
 

1. **Data Structure Preparation**: Your dataset should contain numeric or ordinal scale responses to questionnaire items. Each response is treated as an individual data point.

2. **Plotting with `geom_histogram()`**:
   - **Bin Settings**: By default, `geom_histogram()` will attempt to create 30 bins of equal width, but for questionnaire data, you might set the `binwidth` to 1 if your data are integers representing something like a Likert scale. This will create a bin for each possible score, aligning perfectly with the questionnaire's scoring system.
   - **Aesthetic Mapping**: Map the x-axis to your questionnaire score variable. Optionally, you can fill the bars based on another variable, such as different groups or demographics within your survey population, to compare distributions across categories.
   - **Position Adjustment**: If you are filling based on a factor (like age group or gender), using `position = "dodge"` will place the groups side by side for easier comparison, rather than the default stacking.

3. **Customizations and Improvements**:
   - **Labels and Titles**: Adding clear labels for the x-axis and y-axis, as well as a descriptive title, can help in immediately understanding the plot’s purpose. For instance, x could be "Questionnaire Score" and y "Frequency of Responses".
   - **Theme Adjustments**: Customize the plot appearance using `theme()` to improve readability and presentation quality. For example, adjusting text size, changing the legend position, or modifying background colors.

4. **Statistical Overlays**:
   - **Adding Mean/Mode Lines**: You can overlay additional information such as a vertical line showing the mean or mode of the distribution using `geom_vline()`, which can provide insights into the central tendency of the responses.
   - **Annotations**: Annotate specific features of the histogram, like notable peaks or unusual gaps, to draw attention to important aspects of the data.

5. **Analysis Interpretation**:
   - Histograms allow you to quickly grasp the distribution of responses, identify common and outlier responses, and assess the skewness or symmetry of the data.
   - By comparing histograms from different demographic groups, you can explore how opinions or behaviors differ across these groups, potentially guiding more detailed statistical tests or reporting insights.

#  CGI-S

## Barplot for

The clinical global impression – severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The challenge was to provide data visualisations to show this data and also to provide comparisons between the different groups (e.g. based on response differences or odds ratios for the different response categories) using Clinical Global Impression Data.

# CGI-I

The **Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I)** scale is a widely used tool in clinical trials and practice to evaluate the overall change in a patient's clinical condition over time, as perceived by the clinician. It is often used in conjunction with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the relevance and clinical significance of observed changes.
 

1. **Purpose**:
   - The CGI-I measures the degree of improvement (or worsening) in a patient's condition compared to baseline, from the clinician's perspective.
   - It provides an overall, global impression, considering all available information, including clinical observations and patient-reported experiences.

2. **Scale**:
   - CGI-I is typically a 7-point scale, where:
     - 1 = Very much improved
     - 2 = Much improved
     - 3 = Minimally improved
     - 4 = No change
     - 5 = Minimally worse
     - 6 = Much worse
     - 7 = Very much worse

3. **Relation to Clinically Meaningful Differences**:
   - **Clinically meaningful differences** help define thresholds where changes in outcomes are considered significant or relevant to patients and clinicians.
   - By comparing changes in PROs (like pain scores or quality of life measures) to the CGI-I ratings, researchers can determine what magnitude of change on the PRO corresponds to meaningful improvement in the clinician's eyes.
   - For instance, if a 4-point decrease in a symptom severity score consistently aligns with a "Much improved" (rating of 2) on the CGI-I, this threshold can guide interpretation of treatment effects.

4. **Utility in Research**:
   - **Anchor-Based Methodology**: CGI-I often serves as an anchor in defining clinically meaningful changes in PROs because it reflects a holistic and intuitive judgment from the clinician.
   - **Validation**: PRO instruments may be validated by examining how well their scores correlate with CGI-I ratings.

## Stacked Bar Chart

*Annotation (circling Site 4 in red) and sorting (Site 4 in the upper left hand corner) to make clear that Site 4 is a visual outlier. The visual idiom is a stacked bar chart, one color for each questionnaire. Stacked barcharts are limited when comparing any of the components except the one on the bottom. For the purpose of this data viz challenge, it was only necessary to compare the totals, ie the heights of the stacked bars. This is easy to do for the stacked bars from a visual perception point of view. But the colors for the different components (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) can be distracting.*

```{r,echo = T,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("./01_Datasets/PROdata.csv")

# Convert data to long format for easier plotting with ggplot2
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Q"), names_to = "Question", values_to = "Score")

# Calculate average scores by SITE, TRT, and Question
avg_scores <- data_long %>%
  group_by(SITE, TRT, Question) %>%
  summarise(Average_Score = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot

## Slope Plots

Leverage visual analytics to identify data issues. Consider 4 questions on a Likert scale. 5 rating levels (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree) coded as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The higher the number the better. 400 Subjects (200 active, 200 control).

*We can clearly see that Site 4 is a visual outlier. The Active data for Site 4 looks like it belongs with the Control data from the other sites and likewise the Contorl data for Site 4 looks like it belo9ngs with the Active data from the other sites. Color and a useful title are used to highlight the difference.*

A measure of variability has been added to the plot, derived using bootstrapping methods. The right panel is showing 95% CIs and 95% Prediction Intervals of scores for each category.

CDF plots used for comparing distributions are sometimes superimposed, so this approach may have been useful. However the confidence envelopes couldn’t then be shown simultaneously, so there’d need to be a way of interactively selecting one category at a time. Use of percentage change was discussed – absolute changes are often preferable in a scenario where clinical meaningful changes are being assessed.

## Spaghetti and Distribution Plot

The upper part of the graph is showing the distribution of the score values within each CGI-I category, using density plots of scores on an absolute scale. Distributions are shown separately for baseline and follow-up visits within each category, rather than change from baseline. Individual patient and mean changes are shown using slope plots.

The lower part of the graph shows the distribution of change from baseline values, with a measure of variability being derived using bootstrapping methods. Colour has been used to show paired mean differences outside a +/- 10 unit range.

In general, the graph contains a lot of information and takes some time to understand. However the graph tells a clear story in terms of the distribution of score across different categories, and shows clearly that the Minimally Improved category does not seem to be well differentiated from No Change category.

## Distribution Plot by Category I

This graph includes stacked density plots, sometimes known as a ridgeline plot. This graph type is useful where there are approximately 4-8 categories with a natural ordering, which is the case in this example. The graph is also showing patient level data as transparent dots on the X axis, and reference lines have been added. There is a lot of overplotting of the dots, so the opacity of dots is representing the data density at each value on the X-axis.

## Dot plot

This graph used a different approach, showing only the patient-level data within each category as a scatter plot, with added jittering. The trend between categories is clear, and the number of patients can be compared between groups visually. It was noted that some people find it hard to compare distributions from scatter plots, so a hybrid of scatter plot and a elements showing the distribution, e.g. boxplot or density plot, may have been useful. However the author of the graph mentioned that this graph was intended to be used at the first step of an assessment, to answer the question “is CGI a good enough measure to investigate the meaningful change threshold”

# EORTC QLQ-C30

The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that has been designed for use in a wide range of cancer patient populations and is a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life in cancer patients. It includes a number of different scales, but this challenge is focussed on the global health and quality of life scale (QL).

## Individual Patient Trajectories

EORTC QLQ-C30 is quality of life (QoL) questionnaire designed for use in cancer patients Each item is rated on a 4-point response scale ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very much”) or a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (“Very poor”) to 7 (“Excellent”).

Higher scores represent better outcomes for the global health scale (QL) and the functional scales (PF, RF, EF, CF, SF), whereas higher scores represent higher severe symptoms for the symptom scales/items (FA, NV, PA, DY, SL, AP, CO, DI, FI). The overall QLQ-C30 score is calculated using scoring rules to a range of 0-100.

This figure of change from baseline in QLQ-C30 over time is showing patient-level data as individual lines. Although this is technically a spaghetti plot, a lot of over-plotting occurs due to the discrete nature of the score values. Where this occurs, the opacity of the lines depends on the number of lines that are superimposed, so the figure gives an good general impression of the overall trend. In the left panel (control group), there seem to be more darker lines in the lower half of the plot, showing a worsening of QoL, while the opposite is true in the right panel (experimental group). The figure also includes a superimposed line plot of mean over time (+/- standard error), which shows a similar trend of improvement in global health status in the experimental group and a worsening in the control group.

The use of faint grey gridlines is quite effective. The possibility of using a greyscale for the patient-level data was discussed, because the colour isn’t coding any information and this would make the line plot of mean over time stand out, but it was agreed this would make the patient-level data difficult to distinguish against the gridlines. Some design improvements were suggested, making some of the labels a little larger, and there is also some scope for decluttering the graph, e.g. removing the Y-axis label from the right panel.

## Top four domains Trajectories Dashboard

[App](https://agstn.github.io/qlq-c30/qlq-c30_flexdashboard.html)

First tab: This tab focuses on only the top four domains, in terms of treatment effect. The left panel is showing patient-level data, similarly to the first entry, although data have been jittered to avoid over-plotting. The middle panel shows point estimates, credible intervals and posterior distributions for each treatment and timepoint from from a Bayesian MMRM model. Posterior distributions for the treatment differences are shown in the right panel, with cutpoints added to the density plots to indicate clinically-meaningful threshold values.The graph includes a lot of information but is highly effective in showing trends in the data.

Second tab: this shows the treatment differences for all domains, including point estimates, credible intervals and Bayesian posterior distributions. The domains are sorted in terms of treatment effect, so it is very clear which domains are driving the overall treatment effect. Shading has been used to represent different parts of the posterior distribution curve with respect to the threshold values.

Further tabs give the user a more focused view of what we saw in the first tab, i.e. patient-level data, results of the MMRM and treatment differences, for a single domain, e.g. quality of life, functional scales, symptoms and financial difficulties.

The consistent colour-coding across all panels is helpful, and the colours are similar with respect to their intensity. For the second tab, representing time on the vertical axis is unsual and possibly counter intuitive, but an alternative design may have difficult to implement. Also in the second tab, annotations hadn’t been added to show which direction represents a benefit for each of the scales (which was present on the first tab and was very helpful). But overall this package of graphs provides a rich source of information and clearly shows the important features of the data.

# SDQ-12

The dataset includes item level data for a 12 item (question) Simulated Disease Questionnaire (SDQ-12) at four different timepoints and for 2000 patients. Each item is scored on a 0-3 scale (0 representing worst possible health state/most severe symptoms, 3 representing best possible health state and no symptoms), and a sum score is also calculated by adding all item responses. Each of the 12 items has been simulated to represent a distinct symptom

## Item Response Distribution Plot

This visualization displays the distribution of the individual items over each of the four days available in the data. Each horizontal bar is coloured in varying shades of blue with darker shades indicating higher levels of severity in the corresponding item for that day.

The visualization allows the viewer to quickly identify the greater severities observed on Day 4, and to compare the individual items on each day. This provides a nice overview of the data which is quick and easy to understand. The use of darker shades to represent darker colours is intuitive.

## Wright Map

This final visualization has two features: a histogram displaying the underlying characteristics of the patient population and a supplementary graph displaying the expected response thresholds for the different severity levels in relation to the underlying latent scores.

Again, the plot takes a moment to interpret, but once understood provides a message that is easy to understand. It may help the viewer understood more quickly if the vertical gridlines were continued up to the histogram (or alternatively if the x-axis was positioned between the two plots) to make clear that the two aspects of the visual are connected.

# PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index)

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. For such diseases, it is of interest to not only compare treatments in terms of patients achieving a response, but also in terms of patients sustaining this response once it is achieved. This is the focus of this month’s challenge: produce a visualization to compare treatments with regards to patients sustaining a response. The synthetic data contains PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scores for three treatment groups: two receive an active treatment in different doses; the third receives a comparator. The three arms are balanced, with 300 patients in each. The data contains PASI scores at Baseline and eight follow-up visits, spread over the course of a year. PASI scores can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating a worse condition state. The criteriafor response can be chosen, but typical thresholds include a 75%, 90% or 100% reduction in PASI scores relative to Baseline (PASI75/PASI90/PASI100). More than one threshold could also be considered in the same visualization.

**Sustained response data**

Different approaches could be considered to define a patient as having sustained their response. A simple definition of sustained response could be that having achieved a response at a given visit, a patient then has that response at all subsequent visits. More complex approaches may explore different methods for interpolating between visits.


## Lasagna plots

This visualization is based on patient level data and shows the PASI response over time. Each patient is represented by one line and the three groups are presented in three different blocks. The title is very clear and provides the reader with the main message. Furthermore, the color coding is presented (in the sub-title) as well as the imputation strategy. Therefore, it is very informative.

The selection of the colors is very reasonable. The colors go from red (no response) to yellow (PASI100) which makes intentionally sense considering that we are dealing with dermatology data. You can clearly see a step function over time and that the two active doses lead to a quicker response. Furthermore, at the right end of the plots, we see more yellow areas with the active doses than with the comparator.

The sorting of the patients is a challenge here. Even though the panelists considered the sorting as reasonable, there might be other options, for example, sorting by PASI100 at week 52. An interactive tool where the user can select the sorting might be an option and brings a lot of flexibility into this visualization.

## BarChart

In the main panel, we see a barplot representing the percentage of responders over time. The groups are color-coded and can be easily distinguished due to the nice choice of colors. The (sub)title and the visualization itself have a clear message. Furthermore, the distance between the bars corresponds to the distance in time which is a nice detail.

This visualization has an interactive part: The user can select the percentage cut-off for response (in the left panel). When you select a different cut-off, the dimension of the y-axis remains the same which makes it very easy to compare the results even between the results based on different cut-offs. Furthermore, you can hover over the bars and it will provide you with additional information about the sustainability of the response.

## Trajectory Clustering

[Link to App](https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2021-05-09-wonderful-wednesdays-may-2021/images/kml_response%20-%20Agustin%20Calatroni.html) 
 
This is a very comprehensive visualization. Actually, it is not only a visualization, but also a presentation of a statistical analysis. A trajectory clustering has been performed to devide the patients into five different clusters with different characteristics in regards to their PASI percentage changes.

The row A presents the trajectories of all patients. This gives you a first overview over the data. In row B, the trajectories of the five clusters are provided. This gives you an overview over the different characteristics of the clusters. The first cluster seems to contain patients with a quick response and a very good sustainability of the response. This seems to be the cluster with the best performing patients. The second cluster is very similar, however, patients take a little longer until they respond and the overall level of the percentage change seems to be a bit worse. The third cluster is again a bit worse. The forth cluster still shows some improvement in PASI, however, quite many patients do not reach a good PASI response even at week 52. The fifth cluster contains patients who do not seem to improve in regards to the PASI score. (Note that there are only very few patients in this cluster.) Row C shows basically the same information as row B. An average trajectory per cluster is presented. Row D visualizes the number of patients per treatment group in each cluster using a “Waffle Chart”. And row E presents the percentages of patients per treatment group in each cluster.

The boxes below the plots and the footnote provide additional information about the difference between cluster in their treatment composition. This information is further outlined in the second tab of the app. Using a tree, the differences in the treatment composition between the clusters is visualized.

This is a very interesting and useful analysis and visulization. You can see that the first cluster (which was the best one) contains mainly patients in the two active treatment arms. Thus, we can say that those treatments seem to lead to a quicker and a sustained response compared to the comparator. In the “worse” cluster, we see more patients who were in the comparator arm.

One aspect that could be improved is the coloring in row C. Actually, we do not need any color here, because the colors only seem to be different between the clusters. This information is already given by the structure of the columns, though. Furthermore, the colors are very similar to the colors which are used in row D and E to code the treatment arms.

Overall, this is a very elaborated and advanced visualization which provides the user with a lot of information. At the same time, the structure is very clear which makes it easy to understand the message of the visualization.

# Responder Rate

In a Phase III study involving patients suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa, an active drug was compared to a placebo. Each group consisted of 200 subjects, and the primary endpoint was the HiSCR, which is a binary endpoint. This endpoint is based on three continuous components:

1. Number of abscesses
2. Number of draining fistulae
3. Number of inflammatory nodules

A patient achieves a HiSCR response if all of the following three conditions are met when comparing baseline data to follow-up data (at week 16):

1. At least a 50% decrease in the AN count; AN count is defined as the sum of the number of abscesses and the number of inflammatory nodules.
2. No increase in the number of abscesses.
3. No increase in the number of draining fistulae.

The aim of the study was to compare the two treatment arms in regard to the HiSCR response.

The challenge lies in visualizing the impact of changing the definition of the HiSCR response on the results. For example, altering the first condition to assume that a decrease of 25% or 75% is needed to achieve a HiSCR response could be considered. The second and third conditions could be changed separately, or a mix of changes to two or all conditions can be applied. How does this impact the results?

## Line plots based on reduction in AN count

This visualization shows nicely that the difference between the groups is rather small, if the percentage change to be reached is large (focusing on the first part of the HiSCR responder definition). This is done by presenting a line plot for both groups using two different colors. There are three graphs. Each one of them keeps the second and/or the third part of the definition of a HiSCR responder fixed. Overall, it is a very clean visualization which very nicely tackles the challenge of showing the impact of chaning the definition of HiSCR response.

## Shiny Apps

The app can be found [here](https://bonorico.shinyapps.io/HiSCR/?_ga=2.91645274.1120831357.1651571388-1024467400.1644592220).

This visualization shows on the y-axis the inverse of the risk ratio and on the x-axis the threshold for the percentage decrease in AN count. It is actually an animation showing the impact of changing the threshold for the change of abscesses from baseline. This is a very useful graph to visualize what happens if you change different aspects of the definition. 


![](./02_Plots/Visualization/PRO/Responder_Shiny_a.png)

This is a very simple app which allows you to change the definition of the HiSCR definition (on the left-hand side) to see what happens in the results (on the right-hand side). See [*Shiny\Data Visualization\Responder Bar*]

![](./02_Plots/Visualization/PRO/Responder_Shiny_b.png)

This is a very advanced app which shows a volcano plot in the main panel and it shows what happends in the results when you change the definition on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, you see a table with additional results based on different HiSCR definitions. The panel thinks that it is a not necessarily straightforward to see what is being shown here. However, it is still a very insightful and useful app to understand the impact of changing the definition of HiSCR.

The app can be found [here](https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-06-wonderful-wednesdays-may-2022/images/HiSCR_fig%20-%20Agustin%20Calatroni.html).

# Variability plot

In this plot, the variability (represented by the standard deviation) is plotted over time and by treatment group. This is a very good idea to present the stability of the values.

The title is very nicely done. The first line provides already a very clear message. The second line uses a smaller font size and provides additional information. This plot is very clear and easy to read. Only the coloring could be chosen in a different way as already discussed above.

# Clinical Improvement 

The data reflects a phase III study - active vs placebo and the endpoint was Ordinal Scale for Improvement (OSCI). All patients started at OSCI=4 and daily measures over 35 days were performed. The challenge was to describe the treatment effect specifically taking into account the number and timing of patients who died, left the hospital or fully recovered.

# Regression model-Prediction of health status (EQ-5D)

The data is based on a study to assess the health status in patients with coronary heart diseases (see Ose et al., 2012). The research question was: what factors are associated with health status in usual primary care?

The original data included 2,656 patients with 14 (patient and practice) characteristics (with clustered data structure). The outcome was EQ-5D VAS scale (Health related quality of life; range: [0; 1]). The data set for this challenge is a sub-sample of patients and variables and it is simulated data.
