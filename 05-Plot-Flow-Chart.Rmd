# Introduction

Study flow charts in clinical trials are visual representations of the different stages and processes participants undergo from the beginning to the end of a clinical study. These charts provide a structured, step-by-step outline of the trial's flow, making it easier to understand participant progress and the timing of various assessments and interventions. Flow charts are particularly useful for stakeholders like clinical researchers, sponsors, regulatory agencies, and ethical review boards, as they provide a clear, at-a-glance summary of the study's design.

## Key Components of Study Flow Charts

1. **Enrollment Phase**
   - **Screening:** The initial step where potential participants are assessed against the study's eligibility criteria. This stage identifies who is eligible or ineligible for the study.
   - **Randomization (if applicable):** Eligible participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group.

2. **Intervention Phase**
   - **Treatment Groups:** Participants may be divided into various arms, such as a treatment arm (receiving the drug/intervention) and a control arm (receiving a placebo or standard care).
   - **Assessments:** Flow charts outline when assessments (e.g., baseline, follow-up visits, and final evaluations) take place, detailing each visit or milestone.

3. **Follow-up Phase**
   - **Monitoring and Evaluations:** Key follow-up steps, including adverse event monitoring, efficacy assessments, and quality-of-life measures, are tracked over time.
   - **End of Study Visit:** The final visit marks the formal conclusion of each participant’s involvement.

4. **Outcome and Data Analysis Phase**
   - **Primary and Secondary Endpoints:** Flow charts may indicate the points at which primary and secondary outcomes are measured to evaluate the study’s success.
   - **Completion and Dropouts:** The flow chart shows completion rates, dropouts, and reasons for withdrawal.



## Benefits of Study Flow Charts

- **Clarity and Transparency:** They simplify complex processes, making it easier to communicate trial protocols.
- **Consistency:** By mapping the study’s course, they help ensure adherence to protocol and proper data collection at each stage.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Flow charts provide a visual compliance document for regulatory agencies to ensure all ethical and procedural standards are met.
- **Efficiency in Data Collection:** They guide study personnel in tracking where each participant is in the trial, minimizing errors.

## Gmisc and grid Package

1. **`textGrob` for Text**: I’ve used `textGrob` for the text inside each box.
2. **`rectGrob` for Boxes**: Rectangles (`rectGrob`) are drawn around each `textGrob` to create visible boxes.
3. **`grid.segments` for Connections**: Connections are made with `grid.segments`, adding arrows to match the flow.

## consort package

### Consort diagram produced with consort_plot

When the number of subjects in the final analysis is less than the number of subjects initially entering the study, it is important to detail the observation filtering process. This is often done with a consort diagram, and fortunately R has the consort package by Alim Dayim for drawing data-driven diagrams. To demonstrate its use let’s simulate a two-treatment randomized clinical trial in which 1000 subjects were screened for participation.

```{r,echo = F,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
require(Hmisc)
require(data.table)
require(qreport)
hookaddcap()   # make knitr call a function at the end of each chunk
               # to try to automatically add to list of figure


N <- 1000
set.seed(1)
r <- data.table(
  id    = 1 : N,
  age   = round(rnorm(N, 60, 15)),
  pain  = sample(0 : 5, N, replace=TRUE),
  hxmed = sample(0 : 1, N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.95, 0.05))   )
# Set consent status to those not excluded at screening
r[age >= 40 & pain > 0 & hxmed == 0,
  consent := sample(0 : 1, .N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.1, 0.9))]
# Set randomization status for those consenting
r[consent == 1,
  randomized := sample(0 : 1, .N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.15, 0.85))]
# Add treatment and follow-up time to randomized subjects
r[randomized == 1, tx     := sample(c('A', 'B'), .N, replace=TRUE)]
r[randomized == 1, futime := pmin(runif(.N, 0, 10), 3)]
# Add outcome status for those followed 3 years
# Make a few of those followed 3 years missing
r[futime == 3,
  y := sample(c(0, 1, NA), .N, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.75, 0.2, 0.05))]
# Print first 15 subjects
kabl(r[1 : 15, ])
```

Now show the flow of qualifications and exclusions in a consort diagram. consort_plot wants multiple reasons for exclusions to be prioritized in a hierarchy, and NA to be used to denote “no exclusion”. Use the Hmisc function seqFreq that creates a factor variable whose first level is the most common exclusion, second level is the most common exclusion after excluding subjects based on the first exclusion, and so on. seqFreq also returns an attribute obs.per.numcond with a frequency tabulation of the number of observations having a given number of conditions.


```{r,echo = F,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
r[, exc := seqFreq('pain-free'  = pain  == 0,
                    'Hx med'    = hxmed == 1,
                                  age < 40,
                    noneNA=TRUE)]
eo  <- attr(r[, exc], 'obs.per.numcond')
mult <- paste0('1, 2, ≥3 exclusions: n=',
                eo[2], ', ',
                eo[3], ', ',
                eo[-(1:3)]  )

r[, .q(qual, consent, fin) :=
    .(is.na(exc),
      ifelse(consent == 1, 1, NA),
      ifelse(futime  >= 3, 1, NA))]
            
require(consort)
# consort_plot used to take a coords=c(0.4, 0.6) argument that prevented
# the collision you see here
consort_plot(r,
             orders = c(id      = 'Screened',
                        exc     = 'Excluded',
                        qual    = 'Qualified for Randomization',
                        consent = 'Consented',
                        tx      = 'Randomized',
                        fin     = 'Finished',
                        y       = 'Outcome\nassessed'),
             side_box = 'exc',
             allocation = 'tx',
             labels=c('1'='Screening', '3'='Consent', '4'='Randomization', '6'='Follow-up'))
```


### Consort diagram using component functions

consort provides another way to build the diagram that may be more flexible and intuitive after we define some helper functions. The built-in R pipe operator |> is used.

```{r,echo = F,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
h <- function(n, label) paste0(label, ' (n=', n, ')')
htab <- function(x, label=NULL, split=! length(label), br='\n') {
  tab <- table(x)
  w <- if(length(label)) paste0(h(sum(tab), label), ':', br)
  f <- if(split) h(tab, names(tab)) 
  else
    paste(paste0('   ', h(tab, names(tab))), collapse=br)
  if(split) return(f)
  paste(w, f, sep=if(length(label))'' else br)
}  
count <- function(x, by=rep(1, length(x)))
  tapply(x, by, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

w <- r[, {
 g <-
   add_box(txt=h(nrow(r),       'Screened'))                    |>
   add_side_box(htab(exc,       'Excluded'))                    |>
   add_box(h(count(is.na(exc)), 'Qualified for Randomization')) |>
   add_box(h(count(consent),    'Consented'))                   |>
   add_box(h(count(randomized), 'Randomized'))                  |>
   add_split(htab(tx))                                          |>
   add_box(h(count(fin, tx),    'Finished'))                    |>
   add_box(h(count(! is.na(y), tx), 'Outcome\nassessed'))       |>
   add_label_box(c('1'='Screening',     '3'='Consent',
                   '4'='Randomization', '6'='Follow-up'))
 plot(g)
}
]
```

**waffle chart**

1. **Data Definition**: `data_treatment_A` and `data_treatment_B` define the counts for "Discontinued" and "Completed" for each treatment group.
2. **Color Palette**: The colors for "Discontinued" and "Completed" are set with `colors`.
3. **Waffle Plots**: `waffle` is used to create individual waffle charts for Treatment A and Treatment B.
4. **Combining Plots**: `plot_grid` from the `cowplot` package is used to arrange the waffle plots side-by-side and add titles for the overall plot.

```{r,echo = F,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

data_treatment_B <- c(`Discontinued` = 30, `Completed` = 70)  # Example counts for Treatment B

# Set colors for Discontinued and Completed
colors <- c("Discontinued" = "red", "Completed" = "blue")

# Create the waffle plots for Treatment A and Treatment B
waffle_A <- waffle(data_treatment_A, rows = 10, colors = colors, title = "Treatment A (N=100)")
waffle_B <- waffle(data_treatment_B, rows = 10, colors = colors, title = "Treatment B (N=100)")

# Combine the two waffle plots and add overall title

## ggalluvial package

A Sankey diagram allows to study flows. Entities (nodes) are represented by rectangles or text. Arrows or arcs are used to show flows between them. In R, the networkD3 package is the best way to build them

A Sankey Diagram is a visualisation technique that allows to display flows. Several entities (nodes) are represented by rectangles or text. Their links are represented with arrow or arcs that have a width proportional to the importance of the flow.
