<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Development.png" /> Decision Point
Indicators: The colored circles (green and red) next to each decision
point likely indicate a binary decision-making outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong>: Continue development based on positive
results.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong>: Terminate or modify the approach based on
negative results or strategic reassessment.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Dose Escalation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This phase involves progressively increasing the dose of the drug
administered to groups of patients until the desired therapeutic effect
is achieved with acceptable toxicity levels.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Point 1</strong>: This is likely the Go/No-Go
decision to determine if the drug appears safe and effective enough at
any dose to justify further investigation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept &amp; Dose Finding</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept</strong>: Tests whether the drug has the
biological activity and therapeutic potential anticipated based on
preclinical models.</li>
<li><strong>Dose Finding</strong>: Determines the optimal dose that
balances efficacy and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Point 2</strong>: Another critical Go/No-Go
decision based on the drug’s efficacy and safety data from early-phase
trials. This decision will determine if the drug moves forward to more
extensive testing.</li>

<li>This phase involves larger-scale studies to confirm the efficacy and
monitor side effects, generally leading to the final regulatory approval
phase.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Points 3 and 4</strong>: These likely represent
interim analyses and final analysis points, respectively. At each stage,
the data is reviewed to decide whether to continue the trial, adjust its
parameters, or stop it early due to efficacy or safety concerns.</li>

<h2>Traditional Approach</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Fixed Trials</strong>: This approach follows a rigid,
pre-specified path through the clinical development phases (Phase I,
Phase IIa, Phase IIb, and Phase III).</li>
<li><strong>Issues Highlighted</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor dose selection</strong>: Inadequate dose selection
early in the trial can lead to ineffective treatments continuing through

data.</li>
<li><strong>Underpowered trials</strong>: Trials might not have enough
participants to achieve statistically significant results, often leading
to repeated studies that barely miss their objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition of studies</strong>: Due to the rigid design,
there’s a tendency to repeat studies that barely miss their endpoints,
rather than optimizing based on learned data.</li>
<li><strong>Doomed products not killed early</strong>: Products that are
likely to fail are not terminated early enough, resulting in wasted
resources.</li>
<li><strong>No flexibility</strong>: There’s no opportunity to modify

<h1>Dose Escalation in Early Phase Clinical Trials</h1>
<div id="sadmaddose-escalation" class="section level2">
<h2>SAD/MAD/Dose Escalation</h2>
<p><strong>SAD (Single Ascending Dose) and MAD (Multiple Ascending
Dose)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sequential Cohorts</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>SAD</strong>: Involves administering a single dose to a
small group of participants, with each subsequent group receiving a
higher dose. This continues until a predefined dose level is reached or
unacceptable toxicity is observed.</li>
<li><strong>MAD</strong>: Similar to SAD but involves multiple doses
administered to the same group to assess safety and pharmacokinetics
over a longer period.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dose Escalation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The process starts with Dose 1 and progresses sequentially through
Dose 2, Dose 3, and so on, up to Dose 5 as depicted. This systematic
incrementation helps identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expansion Cohort</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Once an optimal dose is established, an expansion cohort may be
enrolled to further evaluate the drug’s safety and efficacy at this
dose, providing additional data to support phase II trial designs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The SAD/MAD dose escalation strategy is crucial for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimizing risks to study participants by starting at lower
doses.</li>
<li>Efficiently finding the dose that maximizes potential therapeutic
effects while minimizing adverse effects.</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork for effective and safe dosing strategies in
later-phase trials.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Dose1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations in Dose Escalation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The primary consideration during dose escalation is the observation
of DLTs, which are side effects severe enough to prevent an increase in
dose. These help define the MTD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dose Escalation Committee (DEC)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A group of experts that governs dose escalation decisions, ensuring
that the process adheres to safety standards while achieving the
necessary pharmacologic endpoint.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Data</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Critical for determining how the drug is absorbed, distributed,
metabolized, and excreted in the body. PK data guide decisions on dose
levels and scheduling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Response Biomarkers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Biomarkers that respond to the drug treatment can provide early
indications of how well the drug is working at different doses, aiding
in identifying the optimal dose for further studies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Dose2_Range.png" /> 1. <strong>Is there a
range of safe doses where we can explore efficacy?</strong> - Yes, the
therapeutic window shown indicates a range of doses where the efficacy
is high and toxicity is minimal. This range allows for the exploration
of optimal dosing to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing
adverse effects.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Is there a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Maximum Tolerated Dose typically refers to the highest dose of a
drug that does not cause unacceptable side effects. Based on the graph,
the MTD would be near the dose where the probability of toxicity begins
to approach an unacceptable level, potentially around the right boundary
of the therapeutic window or where the toxicity curve starts to steepen
significantly. However, the exact dose isn’t specified clearly in the
graph but would likely be determined by where the risk of toxicity
begins to outweigh the benefits of increased efficacy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="dose-escalation-process" class="section level2">
<h2>Dose Escalation Process</h2>
<p>The dose escalation process is crucial in clinical trials for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Assessment</strong>: It allows for the careful
assessment of a drug’s safety profile at increasing dose levels.</li>
<li><strong>Efficacy Indicators</strong>: Early indications of efficacy
can also be observed and used to make decisions about further
development.</li>
<li><strong>MTD Identification</strong>: Finding the maximum tolerated
dose is essential for determining the dose for Phase II trials, which
will focus more on efficacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology of a dose escalation process in clinical
trials.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sequential Doses</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dose 1 to Dose 5</strong>: The process begins with the
lowest dose (Dose 1) and progresses through increasingly higher doses
(Dose 2 to Dose 5). Each subsequent dose is determined based on the
safety and tolerability data from the previous dose.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cohort Design</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Cohorts</strong>: Typically involves a small number of
participants in each dose level to minimize risk.</li>
<li><strong>Randomization to Placebo</strong>: Some participants receive
a placebo, which helps in the unbiased assessment of the drug’s effects
and side effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dose Levels</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Logarithmically Spaced Doses</strong>: The doses are usually
logarithmically spaced, often doubled, to efficiently find the maximum
tolerated dose without causing significant harm from too large an
increment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Starting Dose</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The initial dose is typically less than 1/100 of the predicted dose
that would cause harm in humans, based on preclinical models. This
conservative start helps ensure participant safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data Review and Escalation Decision</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Review Committee</strong>: After each cohort has been
dosed, a Data Review Committee (DRC) assesses the safety data. This
committee plays a critical role in deciding whether it is safe to
proceed to the next dose level.</li>
<li><strong>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</strong>: The decision to
escalate the dose is primarily based on the presence or absence of DLTs.
The occurrence of DLTs can halt the escalation process or necessitate
dose adjustments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Escalation Rules</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>3+3 Design</strong>: This is a common method used in dose
escalation studies. In this design, three participants are initially
dosed, and if there are no DLTs, three more are dosed at a higher level.
If one participant experiences a DLT, an additional three participants
may be dosed at the same level to better assess the risk.</li>

<h2>Escalation Rules</h2>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Dose3_Rules.png" /></p>
<div id="algorithm-based-rules" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Algorithm-Based Rules</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>3+3</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The most traditional and simplest approach, where three patients are
treated at a given dose level. If none or one patient experiences a
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose is escalated. If two or more
patients experience a DLT, the dose is not escalated, and further
evaluation may occur.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>mTPI (modified Toxicity Probability Interval)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An extension of the traditional interval designs that uses a
Bayesian framework to better estimate the probability of toxicity at
each dose level, allowing for more refined adjustments in dose
escalation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>i3+3 (interval 3+3)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This method integrates features of both rule-based and model-based
approaches, using toxicity intervals to guide dose escalations more
systematically than the traditional 3+3 method.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Dose Insertion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Allows for the insertion of intermediate dose levels based on
accumulating data from the trial. This can help refine the understanding
of the dose-response relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dual Agent PIPE (Product of Independent beta Probabilities
Escalation)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Used for trials involving two drugs, this method considers the
probability of toxicity for each drug independently and adjusts dosing
accordingly, suitable for combination therapy studies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="model-based-rules" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Model-Based Rules</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>CRM (Continual Reassessment Method)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A Bayesian model that continually updates the probability of
toxicity based on patient outcomes at all dose levels tested. The model
aims to more quickly identify the dose closest to the target toxicity
level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>TITE-CRM (Time-to-Event CRM)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>An adaptation of CRM that accounts for the time it takes for a DLT
to occur, which is useful in trials where DLTs may not be immediately
apparent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BOIN (Bayesian Optimal Interval design)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Aims to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with higher
accuracy and fewer patients by defining optimal dose-escalation
intervals based on Bayesian calculations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>BLRM (Bayesian Logistic Regression Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Utilizes logistic regression to estimate the probability of
toxicity, allowing for more complex dose-response relationships and the
incorporation of patient covariates into the decision-making
process.</li>
<li>BLRM employs logistic regression to model the relationship between
the probability of experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and
different dose levels of a drug. This is typically expressed using a
logistic function, which transforms a linear combination of predictors
into a probability between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>The typical logistic model used in BLRM is represented as <span
class="math inline">\(\text{logit}(p_i) = \ln(\alpha) + \beta
\ln(x_i/x_{\text{ref}})\)</span>, where:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is the probability of
toxicity at dose <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ref}}\)</span> is a reference
dose, often the lowest or starting dose.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are parameters to be estimated,
capturing the intercept and the effect of changing the dose level,
respectively.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Dual Agent BLRM</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Similar to the single-agent BLRM but designed for use in trials
involving two therapeutic agents, allowing for the modeling of joint
toxicity probabilities.</li>

<h2>Decision Making</h2>
<p><strong>Early Phase Decision-Making Stages</strong></p>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Dose4_Decision.png" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>FTIM (First Time in Man)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Safety, Biomarker activity</li>
<li>This initial stage involves administering the investigational drug
to humans for the first time. The primary goals are to assess the drug’s
safety profile and to begin evaluating its pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics, often using biomarkers as early indicators of
biological activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>POM (Proof of Mechanism)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Safety, On-target activity</li>
<li>At this stage, the focus is on confirming that the drug acts on the
intended target within the body and elucidates the mechanism of action.
This phase continues to monitor safety while starting to establish a
connection between the drug mechanism and its potential therapeutic
effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>POC (Proof of Concept)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Safety, Efficacy, Phase 3 Translation</li>
<li>Proof of Concept is a critical phase where the drug’s efficacy is
tested, often in a small number of patients who have the disease or
condition the drug is intended to treat. The main objectives are to
establish that the drug works in the intended disease context and to
continue evaluating safety. Successful POC studies provide a rationale
for moving into larger, more definitive trials, and often involve
preliminary discussions on how results could translate into Phase 3
studies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>P3ID (Phase 3 Investment Decision)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This stage is not a trial phase but rather a decision point based on
data gathered from earlier phases. The decision to move forward to Phase
3 involves substantial investment, so this point focuses on evaluating
all data to ensure the candidate has a high likelihood of success in
larger, more costly Phase 3 trials. The evaluation includes further
analysis of safety and efficacy data, along with regulatory
considerations and market potential.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Decision Making Approaches</strong></p>
<p>By employing adaptive designs, Bayesian methods, and biomarker-based
endpoints, clinical trials can become more flexible and responsive to
emerging data, potentially reducing development times and improving
patient outcomes. These strategies also align well with modern
regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and efficiency in drug
development.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Interim Decisions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Interim decisions during trials are common and serve to evaluate the
data partway through the study to make go/no-go decisions. This helps in
optimizing resources and potentially stopping trials early for efficacy
or safety reasons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Single Indication</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Trials often focus on a single therapeutic indication to streamline
the study and concentrate on a specific patient population. This
approach helps in clear interpretation and strong alignment with
regulatory expectations for particular disease areas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Biomarker Endpoint</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Utilizing biomarkers as endpoints in clinical trials can provide
early signals of a drug’s effectiveness or safety. Biomarkers are
measurable indicators of biological processes, pathogenic processes, or
pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sized to Exceed a Minimum Target Response</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Clinical trials are designed to have sufficient power to detect a
clinically meaningful effect. This sizing ensures that the study can
conclusively determine whether the investigational drug has the desired
impact, exceeding a predetermined threshold of response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Simon’s 2 Stage Design</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This is an adaptive trial design used primarily in phase II clinical
trials to minimize patient exposure to potentially ineffective
treatments. The design includes two stages:
<ul>
<li>The first stage assesses initial efficacy (often stopping for
futility if efficacy criteria are not met).</li>
<li>If criteria are met, the trial proceeds to the second stage to
further confirm efficacy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bayesian Interim Decisions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bayesian methods are increasingly common for making interim
decisions in clinical trials. These methods use probabilities to make
decisions, such as continuing or stopping a trial based on the
probability that the treatment response exceeds a predefined threshold:
<ul>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: Continue if <span
class="math inline">\(P(\text{Response} &gt; p_0) &gt;
80\%\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Stop</strong>: Discontinue if <span
class="math inline">\(P(\text{Response} &gt; p_0) &lt;
10\%\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expansion to Pivotal for Accelerated Approval</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Early phase studies may be designed in a way that allows them to
expand into pivotal trials if the interim data is promising. This
strategy can accelerate the path to regulatory approval, especially
under breakthrough therapy designations or accelerated approval
pathways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Determine Baseline Biomarker Cut-off Values</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Defining baseline biomarker cut-off values is critical for selecting
the right patient population or for stratifying patients according to
their predicted response to the treatment. This can optimize the
therapeutic impact and improve the trial’s success rate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bayesian Learning about Biomarker Cut-off Points</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bayesian statistics can be used to refine biomarker cut-off points
based on accumulating data from the trial. This adaptive learning
approach allows for more precise and individualized treatment
decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SCUBA and SBATT Methods</strong>:
<ul>
<li>These are advanced statistical methods employed in clinical
trials.</li>
<li><strong>SCUBA (Sequential Cohort Utility-Based Algorithm)</strong>:
A method that aims to optimize trial designs by evaluating the utility
of adding new patient cohorts based on previous results.</li>
<li><strong>SBATT (Sequential Bayesian Adaptive Therapeutic
Trials)</strong>: Uses Bayesian methods to adaptively manage trials
based on interim data, optimizing trial outcomes and efficiency.</li>

<h1>Combination Design</h1>
<div id="combination-therapies" class="section level2">
<h2>Combination Therapies</h2>
<p>Combination therapies involve the use of two or more treatments
simultaneously to achieve better efficacy than any single treatment
alone. This approach is common in various therapeutic areas, including
oncology, infectious diseases, and chronic conditions like diabetes and
hypertension.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Enhanced Efficacy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The primary goal of combination therapy is to enhance the overall
efficacy of treatment. This could be through different mechanisms of
action targeting various pathways of a disease, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a successful therapeutic outcome.</li>
<li>For instance, in cancer treatment, combining a chemotherapy agent
with an immune checkpoint inhibitor may target both the tumor cells
directly and modulate the immune system to enhance the anti-tumor
response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Toxicity and Overlapping Toxicities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While the efficacy might be enhanced, there is also a risk of
increased toxicity. The combined effects of the treatments can lead to
more severe or additional side effects compared to either treatment
alone.</li>
<li>Overlapping toxicities refer to side effects that are common to both
treatments, potentially exacerbating the patient’s overall burden of
toxicity. Investigating these toxicities is crucial to balance efficacy
with patient safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New and Existing Treatments</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Often, combination therapies involve pairing a new investigational
drug with an existing standard-of-care treatment. This allows
researchers to build on the known efficacy and safety profile of the
existing treatment while exploring the added benefits of the new
drug.</li>
<li>For example, a new targeted therapy may be tested in combination
with a well-established chemotherapy regimen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dose Escalation Strategies</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dose Escalation with New Treatment and Fixed Dose of
Standard</strong>: In this approach, the dose of the new treatment is
gradually increased while keeping the dose of the standard treatment
constant. This helps determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
new drug in the context of the combination.</li>
<li><strong>Dose Escalation of Both Treatments</strong>: In some
studies, the doses of both the new and standard treatments are
escalated. This method can be more complex but is necessary if the
interaction between the two treatments affects their efficacy or
toxicity profiles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Demonstration of Correct Doses and Schedules</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Identifying the optimal doses and scheduling for combination
therapies is critical. The effective dose for one drug might differ when
used in combination compared to its use alone. Clinical trials must
demonstrate that the chosen doses and the treatment schedule maximize
benefits while minimizing adverse effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic (PKPD)
Interactions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>One treatment can influence the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD) of the other. PK interactions might alter how one
drug affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
the other drug. PD interactions could change the drug’s effect at the
target sites.</li>
<li>Understanding these interactions is essential for predicting
treatment outcomes and tailoring the therapy to individual patient
needs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="dose-escalation-with-dual-agents" class="section level2">
<h2>Dose Escalation with Dual Agents</h2>
<p>Dose escalation with dual agents involves complex strategies that are
designed to optimize the effectiveness and safety of two drugs given in
combination. This method is commonly used in cancer therapy, where two
potentially complementary drugs are administered to achieve better
clinical outcomes than could be achieved by either drug alone.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Discover Multiple Dose Combinations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Initially, the goal is to identify several dose combinations that
exhibit acceptable safety profiles. This is usually done through early
phase trials where multiple dosing regimens are tested to establish a
safety threshold.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Efficacy Comparison</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Once safe dose combinations are identified, the next step is to
compare these combinations to determine which offers the best efficacy.
This comparison can often lead to a selection of one or more optimal
combinations for further clinical development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use of Historical Data</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Historical data on a standard treatment (Drug A) and all available
data on a new drug (Drug B) are used to inform dose escalation
decisions. This includes leveraging existing safety and efficacy data to
make educated guesses about starting doses and escalation
increments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specific Models and Methods</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>One Dimensional Dose Escalation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This approach typically involves fixing the dose of one drug (Drug
A) and systematically escalating the dose of the second drug (Drug B).
This strategy simplifies the complexity of managing two moving variables
simultaneously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>3 Parameter BLRM Model</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) might use a formula
like <span class="math inline">\(\text{logit}(p_i) = \ln(\alpha_i) +
\beta \ln(x_j/x_{\text{ref}})\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is the probability of toxicity at a
given dose combination, <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> is the
dose of Drug B, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{\text{ref}}\)</span>
is a reference dose. This model helps in predicting the toxicity of new
dose combinations based on established parameters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Single Dimension CRM</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Based on prior ordering of doses, a one-dimensional Continual
Reassessment Method (CRM) can be applied. This method typically involves
escalating doses of one drug while keeping the other drug dose constant,
guided by the prior assumption about the dose-toxicity
relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Logistic Model with 6 Parameters (Thall et al,
2003)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This more complex logistic model allows for an expanded parameter
set to model the interactions between two drugs more effectively, taking
into account various factors that might affect the dose-response
relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contour Finding Methods (Mander and Sweeting,
2015)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>These methods are used to identify contours of equal efficacy or
toxicity in a two-dimensional dose space. This graphical approach helps
visualize the relationship between dose combinations and their effects,
guiding further dose selection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assumption of Monotonicity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It is often assumed that increasing the dose of either drug will not
decrease its effectiveness or safety. This assumption simplifies the
model by avoiding the need to consider non-monotonic relationships,
although it must be validated for each specific case.</li>

<h2>Seamless Phase 2a/b Combination Design</h2>
<p>The concept of a Seamless Phase 2a/b Combination Design in clinical
trials represents an innovative approach to streamline drug development
by integrating what are traditionally two separate phases into a single,
continuous study. This design allows for the more efficient evaluation
of a therapeutic candidate, reducing the time and cost associated with
transitioning between phases.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Integrated Study Phases</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The design combines early dose-ranging studies (Phase 2a, typically
focusing on safety and dosing) with efficacy studies (Phase 2b). This
integration allows for continuous data collection and analysis without
the administrative pause usually required between phases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Design Elements</strong>:
<ul>
<li>These trials often incorporate adaptive design features that allow
modifications based on interim data. Such adaptations might include
changes in dosing, sample size, or even the inclusion and exclusion
criteria based on accumulating efficacy and safety data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Early and Continuous Efficacy Assessment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By merging Phase 2a and 2b, researchers can begin assessing efficacy
earlier in the clinical development process and continuously adjust the
trial’s focus and objectives based on real-time results. This early
efficacy data is critical in deciding whether to proceed to Phase
3.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Typical Applications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oncology</strong>: Given the urgent need for effective
cancer treatments, seamless Phase 2a/b designs are particularly
prevalent in oncology. They allow for rapid adjustments based on
biomarker responses and early efficacy signals.</li>
<li><strong>Rare Diseases</strong>: In conditions with small patient
populations, combining phases can make clinical development feasible by
maximizing the information obtained from limited patient groups.</li>
<li><strong>Fast-Moving Therapeutic Areas</strong>: Diseases with high
mutation rates such as infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, influenza)
benefit from this approach, as it allows researchers to adapt quickly to
changes in disease behavior or patient needs.</li>

<p><strong>Components of the Seamless Phase 2a/b Combination
Design</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Treatment Arms</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Combination A+B</strong>: Patients receive a combination of
two treatments, aiming to test the synergistic effects of the
drugs.</li>
<li><strong>Monotherapy A</strong>: Patients receive only Treatment A to
evaluate its efficacy and safety as a standalone therapy.</li>
<li><strong>Monotherapy B</strong>: Patients receive only Treatment B,
similarly aimed at assessing its individual efficacy and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: A control group that may receive a placebo
or standard treatment, providing a baseline for comparing the effects of
the experimental treatments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Randomization (R)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Patients are randomized to one of the treatment arms, ensuring that
the assignment of patients is unbiased and that the treatment groups are
comparable in terms of baseline characteristics.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Features and Methodologies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Regulatory Requirements</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Regulators often require clear evidence that each component of a
combination therapy contributes to the therapeutic effects,
necessitating a design that can isolate the effects of individual
treatments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Minimize Exposure to Monotherapies</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The design aims to minimize the number of patients exposed to
monotherapies, especially if the combination therapy is hypothesized to
be superior. This approach can reduce patient risk and improve ethical
outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use of Historical Data</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Historical data from previous studies involving the established
monotherapy can be utilized to inform the study design and analysis,
enhancing the efficiency of the trial by reducing the need for large
sample sizes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unequal Randomization Ratios</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Randomization may be unequal to allocate more patients to promising
treatment arms based on prior evidence or interim analysis findings.
This can help in gathering more data where it is most needed to confirm
efficacy and safety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Dose Dropping Based on Futility at
Interim</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The trial design may include interim analyses to assess the futility
of treatment arms. If an interim analysis shows that a particular dose
or treatment is unlikely to be effective, it can be dropped from the
study, focusing resources on more promising options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contour Finding Methods</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Advanced statistical methods, such as contour finding, might be
employed to determine the optimal dosing combinations based on efficacy
and safety data gathered throughout the trial. These methods help in
visualizing the relationship between different dosages and their
outcomes.</li>

<h2>Seamless P2a/b Dose Response Design</h2>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Seamless2abDose.PNG" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview of the Design</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Multiple Dose Levels</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Setup</strong>: Participants are randomized to one
of several treatment groups, each receiving a different dose level (Dose
1, Dose 2, Dose 3, Dose 4) or a control group.</li>
<li><strong>Transition</strong>: After initial findings, the study
progresses into Phase 2b with a reduced number of dose groups, based on
the data collected during the initial phase. Typically, only the most
promising doses are carried forward to refine the dose-response
relationship and confirm dosage for Phase 3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Control Group</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Both phases include a control group for comparison, which is
essential for assessing the efficacy and safety of the dose levels
relative to standard treatment or placebo.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Features and Methodologies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Model-Based Dose Response</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This approach uses mathematical modeling to understand how different
doses affect outcomes. By employing model-based analytics, the trial
design is optimized to determine the most effective and safest dose with
greater precision.</li>
<li>The model helps predict which doses are likely to be most effective,
allowing for adjustments to be made seamlessly between the phases of the
study.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Using fewer resources to reach dose decisions is a primary
advantage. By reducing the number of dose levels in later phases, the
study becomes more focused and efficient, concentrating resources on the
most promising therapeutic options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Known Dose Response Model</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Often, the general form of the dose-response relationship (e.g.,
linear, sigmoidal) is known from previous studies or related drugs. This
prior knowledge allows for more accurate modeling and prediction from
the data collected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Phasing Out Less Effective Doses</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Initially, a broader range of doses is tested to capture the full
potential dose-response curve. Based on interim analysis results, less
effective or less safe doses are phased out, and the trial continues
with a narrower range of more promising doses.</li>
<li>Typically, Phase 2a starts with more dose groups (4-8 doses covering
a wide range), and by Phase 2b, this is reduced to 2-4 dose groups to
focus on the refinement of the dose estimation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="02_Plots/IA/AD_Seamless2abDoseb.PNG" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Establishing Proof-of-Concept (PoC)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: To demonstrate that a change in dose
leads to a desirable change in the endpoint of interest. This could
involve showing that increasing or decreasing the dose results in
improved clinical outcomes or biomarker responses without unacceptable
toxicity.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: The trial begins with a range of doses to
ascertain the relationship between dose and response. This early phase
is crucial for determining whether the drug has the desired biological
effect and if it justifies further exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dose Finding Step</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: To select one or more “good” dose levels
for confirmatory Phase III trials, where efficacy, safety, and
tolerability are rigorously tested in a larger patient population.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: Based on the data gathered during the
initial phase of the trial, doses that show the best balance between
efficacy and safety are selected for further testing. This phase
involves refining the dose range and focusing on doses that have shown
promising results in terms of efficacy and minimal side effects.</li>

<h2>Seamless Phase 2b/3 Study Design</h2>
<p>The <strong>Seamless Phase 2b/3 Study Design</strong> is an
innovative clinical trial strategy that combines Phase 2b (often the
dose confirmation phase) and Phase 3 (pivotal trials for efficacy and
safety) into a single, continuous protocol. This design allows for a
more fluid transition between the late-stage clinical development
phases, reducing delays, and potentially accelerating the drug approval
process.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of Seamless Phase 2b/3 Study Design</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Continuous Trial Phases</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Instead of conducting separate trials for Phase 2b and Phase 3, a
seamless design merges these into one continuous trial. This approach
typically involves an initial phase (an extension of Phase 2b) to
confirm dosing and early efficacy, which then transitions directly into
the broader Phase 3 studies focused on comprehensive efficacy and safety
evaluations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Modifications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The seamless design often incorporates adaptive features that allow
the study parameters to be modified based on interim data analysis. This
flexibility can include changes in dosage, sample size adjustments,
selection of patient subgroups, or even the primary endpoints, depending
on the emerging data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Interactions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Continuous interaction with regulatory bodies is crucial to manage
the transition points effectively. Interim results are often used to
make go/no-go decisions and may require regulatory approval to proceed
from the modified Phase 2b portion into the Phase 3 trials.</li>

<div id="enrichment" class="section level1">
<h1>Enrichment</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An <strong>Enrichment Strategy</strong> in clinical trials is
designed to enhance the probability of demonstrating a treatment effect
by selecting patients who are more likely to respond to the treatment
based on predefined criteria. This approach can be particularly
beneficial when there’s a clear hypothesis that a specific subgroup of
the population may exhibit a stronger response or better tolerance to
the treatment.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Identification of Subgroups</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Population enrichment involves identifying subgroups within a
broader population that are expected to show an enhanced treatment
effect. These subgroups can be defined based on genetic markers, disease
severity, demographic characteristics, or prior treatment response. The
identification should be based on robust scientific evidence suggesting
that these subgroups are more likely to benefit from the treatment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enrichment at Baseline</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Enrichment strategies are implemented at the start of the trial by
enrolling patients who meet specific subgroup criteria. This approach
ensures that the study population consists predominantly of individuals
who are more likely to respond to the intervention, potentially leading
to more pronounced treatment effects and more efficient study
outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interim Analysis and Adaptation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Trials with an enrichment strategy often include an interim analysis
to assess preliminary data on efficacy and safety. Based on these
interim results, the trial may adapt by focusing further recruitment on
the identified responsive subgroups or modifying treatment regimens for
certain subgroups.</li>
<li>The adaptation based on interim findings must be pre-defined in the
study protocol to ensure transparency and regulatory compliance. This
pre-definition includes specifying the criteria for adaptation and the
statistical methods to be used.</li>
<li>The timing and criteria for interim analysis require meticulous
planning. The analysis should be timed to allow sufficient data
accumulation to make informed decisions without compromising the
integrity of the trial or unduly delaying the overall study
timeline.</li>
<li>Decisions on whether to continue, modify, or stop the trial (or
parts of it) based on interim results should be planned and documented
in advance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Simulation of the Trial Design</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Before implementing an enrichment design, thorough simulations are
necessary to understand the operating characteristics of the trial.
Simulations help predict how the trial might perform under various
scenarios, including different rates of recruitment, varying degrees of
treatment effects within subgroups, and potential dropout rates.</li>
<li>These simulations are crucial for assessing the feasibility of the
trial, estimating the necessary sample size, and understanding the
impact of enrichment strategies on the power and type I error rate of
the study.</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="case-study" class="section level2">
<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p>The TAPPAS trial provides an illustrative example of applying
adaptive design principles in a clinical trial setting, particularly for
treating a rare cancer with limited treatment options.</p>
<p><strong>Angiosarcoma and Current Treatments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disease Background</strong>: Angiosarcoma is a rare and
aggressive form of cancer that arises from the endothelial cells lining
the blood vessels and can occur in any area of the body. The disease is
known for its rapid progression and poor prognosis.</li>
<li><strong>Current Treatments</strong>: Treatment options for
angiosarcoma are limited, typically involving surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy. Pazopanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
inhibitor, has shown modest benefits in treating this disease but is
often not curative and has a limited impact on overall patient
survival.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combination Therapy in the TAPPAS Trial</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pazopanib</strong>: This drug inhibits angiogenesis
(formation of new blood vessels) by targeting VEGF receptors, which are
often overexpressed in tumor cells.</li>
<li><strong>TRC105</strong>: A novel therapeutic agent that targets
endoglin, another protein involved in angiogenesis. Endoglin is critical
for blood vessel growth, particularly in tumor environments. Combining
TRC105 with pazopanib is hypothesized to provide a dual inhibition of
angiogenesis, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes than
either agent alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trial Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary objective of the TAPPAS trial is to demonstrate superior
progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination therapy (TRC105 +
pazopanib) versus pazopanib alone, either in the overall population or
specifically in the cutaneous subgroup of angiosarcoma patients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Population Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Population</strong>: The trial includes all eligible
patients diagnosed with angiosarcoma, regardless of the tumor
location.</li>
<li><strong>Subgroup Focus</strong>: Special attention is given to
patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma, as preliminary data suggest that
TRC105 might offer greater benefits for these patients compared to those
with visceral tumors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adaptive Design Justification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Population</strong>: With only about 1,800 cases per
year in the US, angiosarcoma is classified as an orphan disease, making
it challenging to recruit a large number of participants for clinical
trials.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Prior Data</strong>: The rarity of the disease means
there is limited clinical data available, which complicates establishing
standard treatment protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Greater Benefit</strong>: The hypothesis that
TRC105 could be particularly effective for certain types of tumors
(e.g., cutaneous vs. visceral) supports the use of an adaptive trial
design. This design allows for modifications based on interim data, such
as reallocating patients or adjusting dosages to maximize therapeutic
efficacy and potentially expanding the indications for TRC105.</li>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Case 1: Phase III Two-Arm Group Sequential
Trial</h2>
<p>The RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial was a
significant clinical study focusing on the effectiveness of an
aldosterone receptor blocker compared to a placebo.</p>
<div id="design-of-the-trial" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">1. <strong>Design of the Trial</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: The RALES trial was a double-blind,
multicenter clinical trial. Being “double-blind” means that neither the
participants nor the experimenters knew who was receiving the treatment
or the placebo, which helps to prevent bias in the results.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: It involved a comparison between an
aldosterone-receptor blocker and a placebo. Aldosterone receptor
blockers are typically used to treat conditions like heart failure and
hypertension by blocking the effects of the hormone aldosterone.</li>

<div id="endpoints-and-objectives" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">2. <strong>Endpoints and Objectives</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Endpoint</strong>: The primary endpoint of the trial
was all-causes mortality, meaning the main outcome measured was the
death rate from any cause among participants.</li>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: The trial aimed to determine if there
was a significant reduction in mortality among patients treated with the
aldosterone receptor blocker compared to those given a placebo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="statistics-and-accrual" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">3. <strong>Statistics and Accrual</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anticipated Accrual Rate</strong>: The trial planned to
enroll 960 patients per year, aiming for a large sample size to ensure
robust statistical power.</li>
<li><strong>Hazard Rate</strong>: The hazard rate for the placebo group
was 38%, indicating the expected proportion of patients experiencing the
endpoint (death) during the study period.</li>
<li><strong>Power and Significance</strong>: The trial designers wanted
a 90% power to detect a 17% reduction in the hazard rate, with a
one-sided alpha level of 0.025. This statistical setup means they were
90% confident to detect a reduction in mortality of at least 17% if such
a reduction truly exists, with a 2.5% chance of incorrectly concluding
there is an effect (Type I error).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="interim-monitoring-and-group-sequential-design"
class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">4. <strong>Interim Monitoring and Group
Sequential Design</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six-Look Group Sequential Design</strong>: The design
allowed for accruing efficacy data to be monitored up to six times
throughout the study duration. This approach helps in identifying
treatment effects earlier and can adjust or stop the trial based on
interim findings.</li>
<li><strong>DSMB Meetings</strong>: Six Data Safety and Monitoring Board
(DSMB) meetings were planned for interim reviews, which are critical in
ensuring the safety of participants as the trial progresses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outcome-and-trial-stopping" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">5. <strong>Outcome and Trial
Stopping</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stopping Early</strong>: The trial was stopped early at the
fifth interim analysis (look-5) by the DSMB. Stopping early for efficacy
indicates that the treatment’s benefits were clear and substantial
enough to conclude the trial ahead of schedule, potentially changing
clinical practice sooner.</li>
<li><strong>Time Saved</strong>: The early stop saved nearly two years
of study duration, which was originally projected to end in June 2000
but concluded in August 1998 instead.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Early stopping of the trial for efficacy
suggests that the aldosterone blocker significantly reduced mortality in
the study population. This finding likely had a profound impact on
subsequent clinical guidelines and patient care, especially for
conditions like heart failure where aldosterone plays a crucial
role.</li>

Uncertainty about Nuisance Parameters</h2>
<div id="psoriasis-example" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Psoriasis Example</h3>
<p>The Psoriasis trial example involves: - <strong>Primary
Endpoint</strong>: Achievement of PASI-75 by week 16, which measures
improvement in psoriasis. - <strong>Design Parameters</strong>: Designed
for 95% power to detect a 10% improvement with a new treatment relative
to placebo, with uncertainty about the placebo response rate (π_c =
7.5%).</p>
<p>The problem here is that the power of the trial depends on both the
actual placebo response rate (π_c) and the effect size (δ), which can be
unknown and vary. If π_c or δ are misestimated, it can impact the
trial’s power, making the originally calculated sample size insufficient
or excessive.</p>
</div>
<div id="strategy" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Strategy</h3>
<p>By using an information-based design, the trial is allowed to adapt
by recalculating the necessary sample size based on accruing data about
the actual placebo rate and effect size. This can be done through
interim analyses, where the actual information accrued (J_j) is compared
against the pre-specified maximum information <span
class="math inline">\(I_{\text{max}}\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(J_j\)</span> meets or exceeds <span
class="math inline">\(I_{\text{max}}\)</span>, or efficacy boundaries
are crossed, the trial might be stopped early for efficacy or futility,
or the sample size adjusted to meet the desired power.</p>
<p>This approach proposes using “statistical information” rather than
fixed sample sizes to guide the monitoring and conclusion of clinical
trials. The rationale here is to accumulate enough information to make
robust statistical decisions, thereby potentially making the trial more
efficient and flexible.</p>
<p>This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios like the
psoriasis trial where there is considerable uncertainty about critical
parameters that influence study outcomes. It allows the study to adapt
to the observed data, making it potentially more efficient and likely to
reach conclusive results.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered">Reasons for Sample Size Re-Estimation</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Insufficient Data on New Product:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A novel treatment, like a new monoclonal
antibody for Covid, hasn’t been extensively tested in the target
population. Initial trials may start with conservative estimates that
need adjustment as more specific data about the drug’s efficacy and
safety profile are collected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evolving Standard of Care:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If the standard of care improves during
the trial due to advancements in the control arm treatments, the
relative benefit of the new therapy may appear reduced. This could
necessitate a larger sample size to detect the true effect of the new
treatment under the new standards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Phased Investment Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Sponsors may choose to start with a

<h3 class="unnumbered">Crofelemer Study</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence and Impact</strong>: Diarrhea affects 20-30% of
HIV-infected individuals, posing a significant health burden. This
condition complicates the management of HIV by impairing quality of life
and complicating compliance with antiretroviral medications.</li>
<li><strong>Consequences of Noncompliance</strong>: Noncompliance with
antiretroviral regimens can lead to reduced drug levels, increased viral
loads, and the development of drug resistance, further complicating
treatment and disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Effective Treatment</strong>: Effective management
of diarrhea in HIV-infected patients is crucial as it could potentially
improve overall HIV treatment outcomes by enhancing compliance and
reducing complications related to elevated viral loads and drug
resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Earlier Study Findings</strong>: An initial 7-day study
showed promising results, justifying the progression to a more extended
and rigorous 28-day phase 3 trial to confirm efficacy and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Trial Endpoint</strong>: The primary endpoint for the phase
3 trial is a binary measure: fewer than three watery bowel movements per
week over a four-week period. This endpoint is chosen to quantitatively
assess the improvement in diarrhea and thereby the potential improvement
in patient quality of life and compliance with HIV treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Dose Exploration</strong>: The optimal dose of crofelemer is
unknown, leading to the decision to conduct pairwise comparisons among
three dosage levels (125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg) versus a placebo. This
approach allows the trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of
each dose relative to placebo.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="statistical-considerations" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Statistical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Placebo Response and Treatment Effect</strong>: The
expected placebo response rate is 35%, with an anticipated 20%
improvement with crofelemer treatment. These assumptions are critical
for calculating the necessary sample size and for power calculations to
ensure the study is adequately powered to detect a clinically meaningful
effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implications for Sample Size Re-Estimation</strong>:
Given the uncertainty in the optimal dose and variability in the placebo
response, an adaptive trial design with sample size re-estimation could
be considered. This approach would allow adjustments based on interim
analysis results, potentially optimizing the study design in real-time
to ensure sufficient power and minimize unnecessary exposure to less
effective doses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interim Analyses</strong>: Conducting interim analyses
would allow for the assessment of preliminary efficacy and safety data.
Based on these data, decisions could be made about continuing,
modifying, or stopping the trial for futility or efficacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjustments Based on Conditional Power</strong>: If
interim results suggest changes in the estimated placebo response or
differentially greater efficacy at specific doses, the sample size could
be adjusted to ensure that the study remains adequately powered to
detect significant treatment effects.</p></li>

tests.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Size</strong>: Requires 520 patients for 80% power at

<li><strong>Inverse Normal Combination</strong>: Combines p-values from

weighted contributions based on the sample sizes of each stage.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Testing</strong>: Involves testing a family of
hypotheses (e.g., for each dose) using a hierarchical or closed set

<p><strong>1. Inverse Normal Combination of Stage 1 and Stage 2
p-values</strong></p>
<p>This method combines the p-values from different stages of the study
using a weighted Z-transform approach. The formula provided:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Z_2 = \sqrt{\frac{n_1}{n_1 + n(2)}}
\phi^{-1}(1 - p_1) + \sqrt{\frac{n(2)}{n_1 + n(2)}} \phi^{-1}(1 - p_2)
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables</strong>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n(2)\)</span> are the sample sizes from stage 1
and stage 2, respectively.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> are the p-values from stage 1 and
stage 2, respectively.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\phi^{-1}\)</span> is the inverse of the
standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), which converts
p-values into Z-scores.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The p-values are first converted into Z-scores.</li>
<li>These Z-scores are then weighted by the proportion of the total
sample size contributed by each stage.</li>
<li>The weighted Z-scores are summed to produce a combined Z-score,
<span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span>, which is used to determine the
overall significance across stages.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This method assumes that combining information across stages can lead
to a more powerful test while still controlling for Type I error,
provided the combination rule is properly calibrated.</p>
<p><strong>2. Closed Testing</strong></p>
<p>Closed testing is a rigorous method for controlling FWER in the
context of multiple hypothesis testing, especially when tests are not
independent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary Hypotheses</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The hypotheses are represented by <span class="math inline">\(H_1,
H_2, H_3,\)</span> etc.</li>
<li>The intersections <span class="math inline">\(H_1 \cap H_2, H_1 \cap
H_3,\)</span> etc., represent the joint consideration of multiple
hypotheses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Testing Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A “closed” set of tests is constructed, including all individual
hypotheses and their intersections.</li>
<li>To reject any elementary hypothesis, say <span
class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, all higher-order intersections
involving <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> must also be rejected
at the predefined alpha level.</li>
<li>This method ensures that FWER is controlled under the alpha level
across all hypotheses, as rejecting any single hypothesis requires a
stringent criterion that all related intersections are also
significant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Statistical Rigor</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This approach is particularly strict and can be conservative, but it
ensures that the overall Type I error rate across multiple tests does
not exceed the designated level, α.</li>
