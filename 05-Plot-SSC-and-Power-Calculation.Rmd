# Introduction

As statisticians, we often have to deal with power or sample size calculations. It can be very beneficial to visualise the impact that different factors have on the sample size or power. Produce data visualisation(s) or share tools that help your audience understand how power and sample size calculations work and what impacts the actual results of these calculations.

Power and sample size calculations are fundamental components in the design of any clinical trial or scientific study. These calculations ensure that a study has a sufficient number of participants (sample size) to detect a statistically significant effect if one exists, while controlling for the risk of Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. Visualizing these calculations can enhance understanding and decision-making in study planning by demonstrating the relationships between power, sample size, effect size, and significance level.

## Key Components of Power and Sample Size Visualizations

1. **Power Curves**:
   - A power curve is a plot of statistical power against sample size, often for a range of effect sizes or significance levels.
   - Power curves help researchers visualize how power increases as sample size grows, holding effect size constant. These plots are valuable for understanding how much data is needed to achieve a desired power level, such as 80% or 90%.
   - A typical power curve demonstrates the diminishing returns in power gained by increasing sample size beyond a certain point.

2. **Effect Size vs. Power**:
   - Effect size represents the magnitude of the difference or association being tested. The larger the effect size, the easier it is to detect with a smaller sample.
   - Visualizations plotting effect size against power can show how detectable a given effect is at different sample sizes, helping researchers assess whether their study design is practical for detecting meaningful differences.

3. **Power vs. Significance Level (Alpha)**:
   - This type of plot illustrates how changes in the significance level (alpha) affect statistical power, usually for a fixed sample size and effect size.
   - Lowering alpha (e.g., from 0.05 to 0.01) increases the burden of proof, which can reduce power unless the sample size is adjusted. This visualization can highlight the trade-off between Type I error control and the power to detect true effects.

4. **Sample Size Needed for Various Power Levels**:
   - Visualizations can be used to estimate the sample size needed to achieve different power levels (e.g., 80%, 90%) for various effect sizes and significance levels.
   - This type of visualization often appears as a line or bar chart showing required sample sizes to achieve specific power levels, given certain assumptions about effect size and alpha.

5. **Interactive Visualization Tools**:
   - Interactive tools allow researchers to dynamically adjust parameters like effect size, sample size, and alpha level to see how these changes impact power. These tools are highly beneficial in the planning phase, where researchers can experiment with different configurations.

## Trellised Power Curves::pwrss

The `pwrss` R package enables statistical power and minimum required sample size calculations for:

1. Testing a proportion (one-sample) against a constant.
2. Testing a mean (one-sample) against a constant.
3. Testing the difference between two proportions (independent samples).
4. Testing the difference between two means/groups (parametric and non-parametric tests for independent and paired samples).
5. Testing a correlation (one-sample) against a constant.
6. Testing the difference between two correlations (independent samples).
7. Testing a coefficient (with standardized or unstandardized coefficients, with no covariates or covariate adjustment) in multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression.
8. Testing an indirect effect (with standardized or unstandardized coefficients, with no covariates or covariate adjustment) in mediation analysis (Sobel, Joint, and Monte Carlo methods).
9. Testing an \( R^2 \) against zero in linear regression.
10. Testing an \( R^2 \) difference against zero in hierarchical regression.
11. Testing an \( \eta^2 \) or \( f^2 \) (for main and interaction effects) against zero in analysis of variance (ANOVA), which can be one-way, two-way, or three-way.
12. Testing an \( \eta^2 \) or \( f^2 \) (for main and interaction effects) against zero in analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which can be one-way, two-way, or three-way.
13. Testing an \( \eta^2 \) or \( f^2 \) (for between, within, and interaction effects) against zero in one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA), with non-sphericity correction and repeated measures correlation.
14. Testing goodness-of-fit or independence in contingency tables.

The alternative hypothesis can be formulated as “not equal,” “less,” “greater,” “non-inferior,” “superior,” or “equivalent” in (1), (2), (3), and (4); as “not equal,” “less,” or “greater” in (5), (6), (7), and (8); and always as “greater” in (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14).
