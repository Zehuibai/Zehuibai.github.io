## Log-Log Plot

To check the proportional hazards (PH) assumption in survival analysis, a log-log plot can be useful. This involves three steps:

1. Estimating the survival function, often with the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
2. Estimating survival at specific time points.
3. Plotting log(time) versus log(-log(Survival at time t)).

If the PH assumption holds, the lines in this plot should appear parallel. However, if they converge, diverge, or overlap, this could indicate a violation of the assumption. It’s worth noting that assessing these plots can be subjective—perfect parallelism isn’t always necessary, but the lines should be reasonably close.

Paul Allison, in *Survival Analysis Using SAS*, highlights an often-overlooked perspective: while the PH assumption might not be perfectly met, the average effect observed over time may still be meaningful. He suggests that the focus on PH might sometimes be excessive, as all models involve assumptions, some of which are less critical than others. Statistical tests like `cox.zph` in R’s *survival* package provide a more objective measure of the PH assumption by testing residuals. This balanced view helps in interpreting models where the assumption might not be entirely satisfied, emphasizing that minor deviations don’t always compromise the model's utility.

## Augmented survival plots

Visualise the pattern of events (disease progression, death, etc) on a summary data level or on a patient level data. Highlight differences between treatments or subgroups.

The “trial” aims to determine if a combination of two therapies tablemab (T) plus vismab (V) improves outcomes for metastatic human epidermal growth factor 2–positive breast cancer and increases the pathologic complete response in the neoadjuvant setting (treatment given as a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment or surgery).

The trial has four treatment arms, patients with centrally confirmed human epidermal growth factor 2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to 1 year of adjuvant therapy with V, T, their sequence (T→V), or their combination (T+V) for 52 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

As defined by Cancer.gov: “the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works”.
