# Introduction

Interim analysis, performed according to a predefined analytical plan before the completion of an entire study, is a crucial process in clinical research. This type of analysis is especially integral in Group Sequential Trials (GTS), where the findings from interim analyses can dictate whether a trial should be terminated early. The design of a study can incorporate one or several interim analyses, with each additional analysis increasing the chance of stopping the trial early if necessary. This not only affects the maximum sample size—requiring a larger number to maintain statistical integrity—but also reduces the average sample size needed throughout the trial.


## Why do We Perform Interim Analyses

In the realm of clinical trials, interim analyses are critical components that allow for the potential early termination of trials based on efficacy or futility findings. This detailed summary explores the rationale and implications of these analyses, particularly within group-sequential trials in drug development.

1. **Purpose of Group-Sequential Trials in Drug Development**

Group-sequential trials are designed to allow for early trial termination to save time and resources. For instance, with a hypothetical endpoint such as a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75, a traditional single-stage trial might require 380 events. However, incorporating interim analyses for futility and efficacy can adjust this number. An interim analysis for futility might be set when 30% of the events have occurred (if HR > 1), and for efficacy at about 66% of events, using an O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending approach. This could increase the maximum number of events to 408 but offers the possibility of stopping earlier if criteria are met. Statistically, some trials will cease at these interim points, significantly reducing the number of events needed on average.

2. **Relationship Between Powered Effect and Stopping Criteria**

The effect size that a trial is powered at, such as an HR of 0.75, directly relates to the thresholds used at interim stops for efficacy. For a trial to stop early for efficacy, the observed effect must be strong enough to cross the predefined efficacy boundary, which is typically not drastically higher than the powered effect. This ensures that stopping early does not necessarily mean expecting a much larger effect than initially powered for.

3. **Ethical Considerations: Is Early Stopping "Cheating"?**

Early stopping is sometimes viewed skeptically, as if it were a way to "cheat" the trial process. However, group-sequential methodologies are designed to maintain the overall type I error rate (familywise-error rate, FWER), adjusting the significance thresholds for each interim look. This methodological rigor ensures that the integrity of the trial's statistical conclusions is preserved, not compromised.

4. **Bias in Early Stopping**

Concerns about bias when stopping trials early are valid, especially regarding the accuracy of the estimated treatment effect. However, methodologies have been developed to adjust for such early stopping, providing unbiased estimates of the treatment effect. For example, a trial might stop for efficacy if an interim analysis shows an HR significantly below the threshold, with adjusted analyses confirming the robustness of this finding.

5. **Operational Implications of Early Stopping**

From an operational standpoint, stopping a trial early for efficacy doesn't mean all activities cease immediately. Data continues to be collected on primary and secondary outcomes to enrich the findings and ensure the durability of the treatment effect over time. Moreover, certain data collection efforts that are crucial for regulatory filing might continue, while others may be halted. The trial's unblinding at this point necessitates careful management and analysis of the continuing data collection.

## Key Components of Interim Analysis

**1. Blinding:** 
   - To prevent bias, it's essential that all personnel involved in the trial, except those conducting the interim analysis, remain blinded to the unmasked data and results. Researchers are typically informed only about whether to continue the trial or make amendments to the study protocol.

**2. Rigorous Pre-Design:**
   - A poorly designed interim analysis can compromise the reliability of the trial results. Thus, it's vital to avoid unplanned interim analyses unless absolutely necessary. If an unplanned analysis is conducted, the study report should detail the reason for the analysis, the necessity of unblinding, the potential bias introduced, and its impact on the interpretation of results.

**3. Frequency and Timing of Analyses:**
   - **Frequency:** For instance, a trial might plan for three interim analyses.
   - **Timing:** These analyses can be evenly spaced (e.g., after 25%, 50%, and 75% of data collection) or at irregular intervals, depending on various factors.

**4. Error Control:**
   - **Overall Error Rate:** Typically set at a significance level of 0.05.
   - **Stopping Boundaries:** These are critical for deciding if a trial should be halted early.
     + **Efficacy Boundary:** Utilizes an alpha-spending function to adjust the total sample size and control for Type I error. Crossing this boundary means the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected.
     + **Futility Boundary:** Employs a beta-spending function to adjust the total sample size and control for Type II error. Crossing this boundary suggests acceptance of the alternative hypothesis (H1).

**5. Adaptive Design:**
   - Depending on the results of the interim analysis, modifications may be made to the trial’s design. This could involve adjusting the sample size or altering the trial’s objective (e.g., shifting from a superiority trial to a non-inferiority trial).
  



# Classical Designs without futility stopping

The design of many clinical trials includes some strategy for early stopping if an interim analysis reveals large differences between treatment groups, or shows obvious futility such that there is no chance that continuing to the end would show a clinically meaningful effect. In addition to saving time and resources, such a design feature can reduce study participants' exposure to an inferior or useless treatment. However, when repeated significance testing on accumulating data is done, some adjustment of the usual hypothesis testing procedure must be made to maintain an overall significance level. The methods described by Pocock and O'Brien & Fleming, among others, are popular implementations of group sequential testing for clinical trials.

## Pocock Method

The Pocock boundary is a method for determining whether to stop a clinical trial prematurely. The typical clinical trial compares two groups of patients. One group are given a placebo or conventional treatment, while the other group of patients are given the treatment that is being tested. The investigators running the clinical trial will wish to stop the trial early for ethical reasons if the treatment group clearly shows evidence of benefit. In other words, "when early results proved so promising it was no longer fair to keep patients on the older drugs for comparison, without giving them the opportunity to change."

The Pocock boundary is simple to use in that the p-value threshold is the same at each interim analysis. The disadvantages are that the number of interim analyses must be fixed at the start and it is not possible under this scheme to add analyses after the trial has started. Another disadvantage is that investigators and readers frequently do not understand how the p-values are reported: for example, if there are five interim analyses planned, but the trial is stopped after the third interim analysis because the p-value was 0.01, then the overall p-value for the trial is still reported as <0.05 and not as 0.01.

> Pocock边界易于使用，因为在每个临时分析中，P值阈值相同。缺点是必须在开始时固定临时分析的数量，并且在试验开始后不可能添加分析。另一个缺点是，调查人员和读者经常不了解如何报告P值：例如，如果计划进行五个临时分析，但是在第三次临时分析后停止了试验，因为P值为0.01，则该试验是在第三次中期分析，则应停止。该试验的总体p值仍报告为<0.05，不为0.01。

**With the Pocock design early rejections are more likely.**
 

## O'Brien & Fleming Method

Pocock (1977) first proposed that the crossing boundary be constant for all equally spaced analyses. O'Brien and Fleming $(1979)$ suggested that the crossing boundaries for the kth analysis, $z_{c}(k)$, be changed over the total
number of analyses $\mathrm{K}$ such that

$$
z_{c}(k)=z_{O B F} \sqrt{K / k}
$$
The O'Brien-Fleming boundaries have been used more frequently because they
preserve a nominal significance level at the final analysis that is close to that of a single test procedure.

With the O'Brien & Fleming design the early rejection bounds are large and early
rejections are rather unlikely, at least under $\mathrm{H} _0$. With the O'Brien\& Fleming design the last rejection bound is close to the un-adjusted bound $Z_{\alpha / 2}$. This is not the case for Pocock's design. In practice, the O'Brien & Fleming design is generally preferred, since early rejection without overwhelming evidence may not be convincing.

> 使用O'Brien＆Fleming设计，早期的拒绝界限很大且早期拒绝不太可能

## Wang & Tsiatis Method

Wang & Tsiatis (1987) suggest the rejection boundaries

$$
u_{k}=\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{WT}}(K, \alpha, \beta, \Delta) k^{\Delta-0.5}
$$

- For $\Delta=0$ we obtain the O'Brien & Fleming boundaries.
- For $\Delta=0.5$ we obtain Pocock's boundaries
- For $0<\Delta<0.5$ we obtain a compromise between $\mathrm{P}$ and OBF.


## Rejection bounds and Local p-values

**Rejection bounds**

Rejection regions with rejection bounds $u_{k}, k=1, \ldots, K$.
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{R}_{k}^{*}=\left\{\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right| \geq u_{k}\right\}=\left(-\infty,-u_{k}\right) \cup\left(u_{k}, \infty\right) \\
\mathcal{A}_{k}^{*}=\emptyset, \mathcal{C}_{k}^{*}=\left(-u_{k}, u_{k}\right) \text { for } k<K, \text { and } \mathcal{A}_{K}^{*}=\left(-u_{K}, u_{K}\right)
\end{array}
$$
Design of Pocock (1977): Constant rejection bounds, i.e.
$$u_{1}=\cdots=u_{K}=c_{\mathrm{P}} \text{with} c P=c P(K, \alpha)$$ such that
$$\mathbf{P}_{\mu_{0}}\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}\left\{\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right| \geq c_{P}\right\}\right)=\alpha$$
Design of O'Brien \& Fleming (1979): Decreasing rejection bounds with $u_{k}=c_{\mathrm{OBF}} / \sqrt{k}$ with $c \mathrm{OBF}=c \mathrm{OBF}(K, \alpha)$  
$$\mathbf{P}_{\mu_{0}}\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}\left\{\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right| \geq C_{\mathrm{OBF}} / \sqrt{k}\right\}\right)=\alpha$$

**Local p-values**

$$
\begin{array}{c}
p_{k}^{*}:=2\left(1-\Phi\left(\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right|\right)\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K \\
\text { Namely: } \quad\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right| \geq u_{k} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad p_{k}^{*} \leq \alpha_{k}:=2\left(1-\Phi\left(u_{k}\right)\right)
\end{array}
$$

* Constant local levels in the Pocock design: $$\alpha_{1}=\cdots=\alpha_{K}=2\left(1-\Phi\left(C_{\mathrm{P}}\right)\right)$$
* Decreasing local levels of the O’Brien & Fleming design: $$\alpha_{k}=2\left(1-\Phi\left(c_{\mathrm{OBF}} / \sqrt{k}\right)\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K$$


## Power and Sample size

As argued before, the maximum sample size $N_{K}$ required for power $1-\beta$ is a multiple of the **fixed size**
$$
\begin{array}{l}
n_{f}=\left(z_{\alpha / 2}+z_{\beta}\right)^{2} / \delta_{1}^{2} \\
N_{K}=n_{f} \cdot I(K, \alpha, \beta)
\end{array}
$$
The inflation factor $I(K, \alpha, \beta)$ depends on the type of design, e.g. whether Pocock or O'Brien \& Fleming.

**Average Sample Size**

The required stage-wise sample size is 
$$n=N_{K} / K=n_{f} \cdot I(K, \alpha, \beta) / K$$
Consequently, we get for the ASN
$$\frac{\operatorname{ASN}(\mu)}{n_{f}}=\frac{I(K, \alpha, \beta)}{K} \underbrace{\left(1+\sum_{k=2}^{K} \mathbf{P}_{\vartheta_{1}}\left(Z_{1}^{*} \in \mathcal{C}_{1}^{*}, \ldots, Z_{k-1}^{*} \in \mathcal{C}_{k-1}^{*}\right)\right)}_{\text {average number of stages }}$$











# Classical Designs with binding futility stopping

## Symmetric designs

Pampallona & Tsiatis (1994) suggest to use a GSD with a symmetric interim acceptance region:
$$
\mathcal{A}_{k}^{*}=\left[-u_{k k}^{0}, u_{k}^{0}\right], \quad \mathcal{C}_{k}^{*}=\left(-u_{k}^{1},-u_{k}^{0}\right) \cup\left(u_{k}^{0}, u_{k}^{1}\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K
$$
for specific $0<u_{k}^{0}<u_{k}^{1}(k<K)$ and $0<u_{K}^{0}=u_{K}^{1}$
This means to accept $H_{0}$ at stage k if $|Z k| \leq u k^{0}$, and to reject $H_{0}$ at stage k if $\left|Z_{k}\right| \geq u_{k}^{1}$

The method can be implemented by using the acceptance bounds
$$
u_{k}^{0}:=\max (\underbrace{\left[\sqrt{k / K}\left(c^{0}+c^{1}\right)-c^{0}\right] K^{\Delta-0.5}}_{\text {the original } u_{k}^{0}}, 0)
$$


## One-Sided Designs

Without early acceptance we would now choose:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{C}_{k}^{*}=\left(-\infty, u_{k}\right), \quad \mathcal{A}_{k}^{*}=\emptyset, \quad k=1, \ldots, K-1 \\
\mathcal{R}_{k}^{*}=\left[u_{k}, \infty\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K, \quad \mathcal{A}_{K}^{*}=\left(-\infty, u_{K}\right)
\end{array}
$$
Type I error rate control:
$$
\mathbf{P}_{\mu_{0}}\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}\left\{Z_{k}^{*} \geq u_{k}\right\}\right)=\alpha  
$$
One-sided GSD with early acceptance: DeMets \& Ware $(1980,1982)$ suggest to use a constant futility boundary $u^{L}<u_{k}$ for all $k \leq K-1$, With this futility
boundary the decision regions become
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{C}_{k}^{*}=\left(u^{L}, u_{k}\right), \quad \mathcal{A}_{k}^{*}=\left(-\infty, u^{L}\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K-1 \\
\mathcal{R}_{k}^{*}=\left(u_{k}, \infty\right), \quad k=1, \ldots, K, \quad \mathcal{A}_{K}^{*}=\left(-\infty, u_{K}\right)
\end{array}
$$

# Alpha Spending Function Approach

**GSD with unequally sized stages**

Assume that we have planned the GSD with equally spaced stages, but the stage-wise sample sizes $n_k$ are unequal. We can calculate all boundaries (e.g. Pocock or O’Brien & Fleming) also with unequal stages.

> 如果只是为了控制假阳性，可以将提前比较视为多次比较，使用多重检验方法进行校正。但是实验中数据相关性较强，多重校正会增大假阴性错误，并不合适。alpha消耗函数的思路是将假阳性错误按照某种方案分配给每次比较，每次比较消耗一定的假阳性配额，合计后刚好等于预设水平。
当某个临床研究分若干阶段进行整体决策时（如基于有效性或无效性所做的期中分析），每个阶段都要消耗一定的α，随着研究进展，研究所完成的比例（如1/3、1/2、60%等）与累积的I类错误率呈现某种函数关系. 每次消耗为
$$ \alpha_{1}^{*}=\alpha\left(t_{1}^{*}\right)-\alpha(0),$$ $$\alpha_{2}^{*}=\alpha\left(t_{2}^{*}\right)-\alpha\left(t_{1}^{*}\right), \ldots,$$ $$\alpha_{n}^{*}=\alpha(1)-\alpha\left(t_{n-1}^{*}\right)$$ 
根据定义可知$\alpha_{1}^{*}=\alpha\left(t_{1}^{*}\right), \sum \alpha^{*}=\alpha,$

 
It is usually difficult or even impossible to achieve the pre-planned sample sizes perfectly. One reason is that we need to fix a date for the DMC to meet. So solve this issue, Lan \& DeMets suggest to fix the maximum sample size $\mathrm{N}$ and a
"spending function at level " $\alpha^{*}(t), \quad t \in[0,1]$ that is strictly increasing with $\alpha(0)=0$ and $\alpha(1)=\alpha$

- In the 1 st interim analysis (IA) calculate $t_{1}=n_{1} / \mathrm{N}$ and $u_{1}, \mathrm{~s}$.th.
$\mathbf{P}\left(\left|Z_{1}^{*}\right| \geq u_{1}\right)=\alpha^{*}\left(t_{1}\right)$
- In the 2nd IA we calculate $t_{2}=\left(n_{1}+n_{2}\right) / N$ and $u_{2}, \mathrm{~s}$.th.
$\alpha_{1}^{*}\left(t_{1}\right)+\mathbf{P}\left(\left|Z_{1}^{*}\right|<u_{1},\left|Z_{2}^{*}\right| \geq u_{2}\right)=\alpha^{*}\left(t_{2}\right)$
- In the $k^{\text {th }}$ IA calculate $t k=(n 1+\cdots+n k) / N$ and $u_{k}$ 

$$
\alpha^{*}\left(t_{k-1}\right)+\mathbf{P}\left(\left|Z_{1}^{*}\right|<u_{1}, \ldots,\left|Z_{k-1}^{*}\right|<u_{k-1},\left|Z_{k}^{*}\right| \geq u_{k}\right)=\alpha^{*}\left(t_{k}\right)
$$
This means to use the level $\alpha^{*}\left(t_{k}\right)$ up to stage $k$

**Examples for spending functions**

* To mimic Pocock's design (Lan \& DeMets, 1983):
$\alpha_{1}^{*}(t)=\alpha \log (1+(e-1) t), \quad t \in[0,1]$
* To mimic the O'Brien \& Fleming design (Lan \& DeMets, 1983):
$\alpha_{2}^{*}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}4\left\{1-\phi^{-1}\left[\Phi(1-\alpha / 4) / \sqrt{t_{k}}\right]\right\} \\ 4\left\{1-\phi^{-1}\left[\Phi(1-\alpha / 2) / \sqrt{t_{k}}\right]\right\} & \begin{array}{l}\text { one-sided } \\ \text { two-sided }\end{array}\end{array}\right.$
* Spending function family of Kim \& DeMets (1987)
$\alpha_{3}^{*}(\rho, t)=\alpha t^{\rho}, \quad t \in[0,1], \quad$ for some $\rho>0$

## Group-sequential designs for conti and binary

Sample size calculation for a group-sequential trials is performed in two steps:

1. Define the (abstract) group-sequential design using the function getDesignGroupSequential(). For details regarding this step, see the R markdown file “Defining group-sequential boundaries with rpact”.
2. Calculate sample size for the continuous endpoint by feeding the abstract design into the function getSampleSizeMeans().


```{r GSD-sample-size,echo = T,message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## Survival endpoint

The relevant rpact functions for survival are:

* `getPowerSurvival()`: This function is the analogue to getSampleSizeSurvival() for the calculation of power rather than the sample size.
* `getEventProbabilities()`: Calculates the probability of an event depending on the time and type of accrual, follow-up time, and survival distribution. This is useful for aligning interim analyses for different time-to-event endpoints.
* `getSimulationSurvival()`: This function simulates group-sequential trials. For example, it allows to assess the power of trials with delayed treatment effects or to assess the data-dependent variability of the timing of interim analyses even if the protocol assumptions are perfectly fulfilled. It also allows to simulate hypothetical datasets for trials stopped early.

### Specifying survival distributions

**Exponential survival distributions**

* Event probability at a specific time point known `eventTime = 24, pi2 = 0.3, pi1 = 0.2`
* Exponential parameter $\lambda$ known
* Median survival known $\lambda = \log(2)/\text{median}$

**Weibull survival distributions**

Additional scale parameter kappa needs to be provided which is 1 for the exponential distribution.


### Without interim analyses

**Exponential survival, flexible accrual intensity, no interim analyses**

+ Exponential PFS with a median PFS of 60 months in control (lambda2 = log(2)/60) and a target hazard ratio of 0.74 (hazardRatio = 0.74).
+ Log-rank test at the two-sided 5%-significance level (sided = 2, alpha = 0.05), power 80% (beta = 0.2).
+ Annual drop-out of 2.5% in both arms (dropoutRate1 = 0.025, dropoutRate2 = 0.025, dropoutTime = 12).
+ Recruitment is 42 patients/month from month 6 onwards after linear ramp up. (accrualTime = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6), accrualIntensity = c(6,12,18,24,30,36,42))
+ Randomization ratio 1:1 (allocationRatioPlanned = 1). This is the default and is thus not explicitly set in the function call below.
+ Two sample size choices will be initially explored:
    - A fixed total sample size of 1200 (maxNumberOfSubjects = 1200).
    - Alternatively, the total sample size will be implicitly determined by specifying that every subject must have a minimal follow-up duration of at 12 months at the time of the analysis (followUpTime = 12).
